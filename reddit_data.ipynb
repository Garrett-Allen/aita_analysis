Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\\n\\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\\n\\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore.

Here's some of the undesirable qualities about him.\\n\\n* Incredible snoring. I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven't approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was \"have you told him about your snoring??\" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It's too loud not to know. This is fine, you can't help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I'm not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point...\\n\\n* He's a lazy fuck. He's very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it's because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn't do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn't help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality..\\n* He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn't stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a \"stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3\". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn't even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it.\\n\\nTonight though, I thought about something. I am talking about him a lot. I mean, he gives me a lot to talk about. However, I feel like I may be just as bad as he is, talking about him and the things he does with my friends and floormates behind his back. So, am I the asshole? Am I the asshole for talking about him so much and making such a big deal out of him, or is he simply the asshole and I'm responding to that?\\n</td>\n",

My wife told me she didn't use an excuse out of my cousin's wedding.\\n\\n[AITA] #1: I angrily replied my wife was being unfair because no one in her family was dying of cancer when my cousin was getting married.\\n\\n[AITA] #2: My wife replied my mom isn't dying, just very ill, so it would be selfish of me to take care of her. I told my wife she was being an asshole and walked away.\\n\\nI'm struggling with the ethics on this one.

       "      <td>I'm likely going to get some flak for arguing with someone over the phone, but the fact that I couldn't speak with her face-to-face was actually the reason this whole thing happened in the first place. \\n\\n  This former friend of mine often met with me for lunch or coffee or whatever every so often, and we'd make a day of it, as we lived in towns roughly 100 miles apart. To do this, we typically arranged something via text message, which worked totally fine. \\n\\n  Anyway, the last time I saw her was in November, and admittedly she was, at the time anyway, busy with a number of commitments and problems that had come up. However, I have my own commitments including a job and voluntary events, and she was totally aware of this, as well as being aware that I was also similarly going through a number of issues of my own. It cannot have been an issue of time as she had more free time than I do and a lot more money than me too, despite being on welfare benefits and getting things like a house (something I would so desperately love) pretty much given to her. Then she meets me and whines about how terrible the house is or how she's bored sitting in the house all day, knowing fine and well I've got to work for the little money I earn. \\n\\n Anyway, we agreed in November that we'd try and meet in December, just before Christmas. When this didn't happen, I hoped that we could at least have a coffee before the New Year came round and I would be busy at work. In both cases it was always some excuse or another, and eventually New Year came without me hearing a single word from her. \\n\\n  So come the middle of January I rang her and asked her what was happening. She promised me **faithfully** that in two weeks time (the start of Febuary) she'd meet me. This, like the other previous times, she told me she couldn't meet me and it would be two weeks before she could meet me. I told her that she should ring me in a week and let me know what was happening, as I'd had some holidays booked from work and so was freer than usual to meet. \\n   \\n  I made a point of waiting until last week to give her some space, but when the usual promise of meeting in two week's time got trotted out, I gave her an ultimatum via text. I'll bulletpoint the texts in paraphrased fashion:\\n\\n* **Text 1**: Look, all I'm asking for is a date. I've got my work and I'm also bored of getting messed around, bearing in mind I'm being promised you'll meet me. \\n\\n*Her response: Yeah well I've got problems in my life and all I'm trying to do is be a good friend, and you're making demands of me and being horrible to me.*\\n\\n**Text 2**: Well yeah, I've got problems too. Also, you did stuff wrong too, and you seem more interested in yourself than anyone, despite you calling me a friend**\\n\\n*Her response: Well this is all your fault, you seem to think your whole life is dependent on me. Just go and do whatever you want, I don't care.*\\n\\n**Text 3 (final text)**: Surprise, surprise, it's my fault. Act like an adult, not a kid, and actually realise that you're not the centre of my life, and that you're acting like it's the end of the world because I actually want to know what's happening in my life, bearing in mind you're expecting me to spend good money on petrol and food. \\n\\n  This prompted a long, rambling phonecall (which I ignored for the most part) about how she 'wasn't friends with me any more' and how she hated me. Since then I haven't heard a word from her. \\n\\n  So, who is the asshole in this situation?\\n\\n</td>\n",

My best friend (let's just call him Shane) used to really like this girl (let's call her Hannah) who is in our grade and is good friends with the \"junior girls\". So last year he started hanging out with Hannah and the junior girls so that he could get closer to Hannah. The junior girls really took a liking to Shane, which made me jealous. He never admitted it until recently but he liked the attention he got from them. But back to my point, he totally left me in the dust while he ran off with Hannah and the junior girls. I spent the better part of my freshman year trying to get the junior girls' attention (which I regret wholeheartedly) and it failed. In fact, it ended up making me look even worse, and pathetic. Fast forward to the beginning of this year, where I apparently made Hannah mad in a way that I don't really recall (it was several months ago) which made her chew me up saying that I \"ruin friendships\" and that I'm \"one of the rudest people she's ever met.\" Which made the junior girls hate me even more.

This is the longest time that I have spent at their house in the past three and a half years for a slew of reasons. I usually only come home for a few days around holidays and then ship off back to school. I did not want to spend this much time at home, my parents basically bribed me back by paying my rent and bills for the month of February and March. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or unappreciative, I really appreciate their help, but I have been completely financially independent for the past three years and that is the way that I like it. I don't mind providing for myself and being responsible for myself financially, I actually prefer it because I don't feel obligated to other people. However, my parents were extremely adamant about me spending some time at home over my break. They don't fully understand my reasonings for taking this semester off and think that it's because I am unstable or something, which is untrue I simply needed a break like many students. Anyways, I've been here and been absolutely miserable. I hate the job that I'm working here and absolutely prefer the one at school. I don't have many friends here so I've been incredibly bored.

       "      <td>A couple years back, I had a massive fight with a very close friend. The friendship ended with lots of (metaphorical) bloodshed, though in my defense, I was a high school freshman and afraid of having a direct confrontation. \\n\\nBasically, me and this chick M had been total best friends for about a year after I had moved to a new school. She was the first friend I made and being the insecure eighth-grader I had been I latched onto her like a cross between a leech and a member of a cult dedicated to her worship. \\n\\nIn the beginning, at least, she had been pretty much an ordinary best friend. She liked to draw, when we hung out around the school afterschool doing homework, she'd usually end up doodling something. She would always make a big game out of me not being able to see it until it's done (which was basically never since she's way too lazy to finish drawings), so I made a big game out of finding ways to dramatically steal it. It was like an inside joke between us.\\n\\nOur friendship was fine, until she slowly became obsessed with the idea of internet fame (mostly through her drawings or possibly her modeling). She made a bunch of internet friends through tumblr and would constantly be tweeting them and talking about them. She tried to make an effort to have me get to know them, though it felt more like showing her internet friends her irl groupies than trying to include me in her new group of friends.\\n\\nWe would still hang out, but she started expecting me to be constantly showering her with praise (which I had happily done without being asked in the past), but in return she would endlessly belittle me. \\n\\nHere's a conversation that I still vividly remember. The context is she was compiling info on a bunch of our friends in order to draw fanart of us in a Victoria's Secret alternate universe.\\n\\nM: Wow, your waist is (i don't remember the number) centimeters, that's twice as much as mine!\\n\\nme: Yeah, well my bigger boobs came at a price. (she's flat as a board and skinny as a toothpick)\\n\\nM: Yeah, well Behati only has 34B, so maybe yours are too big. Oh that reminds me in the VSAU, you obviously can't be a model. I think you'd make a good casting director though.\\n\\nIn this Victoria's Secret fantasy of hers she was/is dating Adam Levine and is a Victoria's Secret Angel. As a direct result of her pipe dream relationship with Adam, she banned me from being a fan of Adam and said that I could like James Valentine, the guitarist from the same band. She also \"claimed\" Sherlock from BBC Sherlock and several other guys that she considered hot. \\n\\nBasically, the rest of the group of friends and I were getting tired of her shit. We all were starting to realize what a bitch she was being a lot of the time and some of us (me being the strongest advocate) wanted to just cut ties. I was definitely the person that was closest to her, so they all pretty much accepted that I knew her best. But none of us wanted to have to confront her.\\n\\nWhat ended up happening is that she realized that I was mad at her because I had been talking to her much less. Her first instinct was to get closer with the others, but because of the horror stories I told them they didn't want to be the next person she took out her insecurities on. She then started ignoring us back. The whole while this was going on we all still hanging out like normal in school, though not outside of school.\\n\\nAfter about a week of ignoring us she just stopped sitting with us. We were all grateful and went back to normal really quickly, even laughing at how the only people that came to her birthday party other than her family was her dad's employee's daughter.\\n\\nMeanwhile, she was asking mutual friends what she had done wrong and why we'd been mad at her in the first place. She genuinely had no idea what she had done wrong. I still feel really bad about what I did to her, even though she quickly found another group of friends for hanging out with during school and she still had her internet friends. \\n</td>\n",

I posted the whole story in /r/pettyrevenge and got a really mixed bag of responses, so I'm curious what people here think.\\n\\nBasically, I was at a John Mayer concert, in a pretty good seat but off to the side (not in the pit, which is relevant). When JM came out, he was playing a really rockin' tune, so I stood up and started jamming out. I would say ~90% of the people in the arena were standing for this, but my section was a disproportionately sitting one. I was really the only one in the immediate area standing. I would stand and sit intermittently as the songs went on based on the dance-factor of the song and how much I liked it.\\n\\nAt one point while I was standing up, two women about four rows behind me started throwing popcorn at me and yelling at me to sit down. I got really embarrassed and sat, but after a few minutes I was upset with how they had handled it, so a few songs later, I stood back up (with the help of my girlfriend and a few other people around us who had scene the exchange). By this point a few other isolated people/couples had done the same for a couple songs at a time. My \"petty revenge\" was subtly encouraging people around me to stand up, helping create a majority so that a.) it would be fine for me to stand and b.) the women would have a harder time telling 20 people to sit down.\\n\\nTo be fair, I was a lot meaner in the telling in /r/pettyrevenge, so [here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y9dny/standing_up_for_my_right_to_stand_up/) if you'd like to read it and the ensuing comments. I just kind of assumed people would be on my side, as you can tell by my whiny edit at the top. \\n\\nAm I the asshole? I want to believe I'm not, mostly because I think throwing popcorn at someone is incredibly rude, at which point I didn't care, and I would have responded much more sympathetically to a more gentle approach. Other people felt that I was not entitled to any courtesies because I started the asshole train by standing in the first place, and honestly I understand that too, which is why I sat down in the first place. I didn't want to be rude and block views. But I also believed that I wasn't in the wrong to stand given the nature of the act--he's got some jams and is very encouraging of light dancing. Still, for people that just wanted to sit down and enjoy the show, I was definitely hurting the experience.

So on Saturday night, place is really busy, I have a million things to do, just the usual.  Co-worker sits a table of four and spends about ten minutes standing there talking to them. Door hosts usually just give them menus, tell them info about the place and hand them off to me. He finally stops chatting and waves me over and says they want to order. \\n\\nFor the rest of the time they are there he is CONSTANTLY coming over to them, for a good 10 minutes at a time, leaving the other door host, who has worked there for 2 days, by herself on the door.  They want to order more drinks and instead of telling me, which is standard procedure, he goes off to the bar and gets them himself.  I ended up having to ask them what they had so I can add it to the bill which I find really unprofessional.\\n\\nThey ask for the bill, I drop it and go to the back to get a drink for someone, and I come back to find him taking the payment.  Now door hosts are not floor or till trained, they are in no way allowed to use the micros, put in orders or take payments.  However I'm not going to go charging up in front of guests and grab the card machine from him so I let it happen.  I then find out at the end of the night he was boasting to other members of staff that my table gave him a £10 tip and he's keeping it.\\n\\nSo I put in a complaint to management, the next day they have an investigation meeting, I was on the floor at the time and during the course of the meeting he is crying and getting really upset.

The lesson ended short, so the instructor gave us permission to look up videos on YouTube for the remainder of class (only a couple of minutes).

I asked him if he wanted to watch something, and he said he didn't care, and I didn't know what to bring up on such short notice, but then something came to me.\\n\\nPrevious to my attendance at the camp, a friend showed me [this odd video](http://youtu.be/NyieI2bxyIk) about spiral cutting hot dogs. Forgetting this kid was vegetarian, I brought it up and had him watch it, eager to see his reaction. He was rather indifferent, and it was only later I remembered he was a vegetarian.\\n\\nWhen I realized that, it was already too late to apologize to him as camp was over, but I still felt kind of bad about it for some reason, despite him never mentioning the incident.

Next saturday there would be a twitter meetup, in a student village and the plan was to go out. I planned to go with that (girl) friend of mine and asked to borrow the car from my parents since I didn't feel like hanging out all night with these people. (They have met lots of time and 80% of their friends are actually from twitter).\\n\\nThe monday of that week, I went to TED and thanks to Foursquare I discovered that there were some 'tweeps' over there there too, I talked to them for 5 minutes and he told me to come to the meeting.\\n\\nLater that week, another girl (let's call her Crazy Bitch or CB) had some free tickets to the avant-première of Thor 2 in a movieplex nearby, I replied and went over there to meet her and watch the movie. It was fun and asked if she came to the meetup aswell. She did and I told her she could come along with us since I have 4 places in the car and appearantly we live nearby. We ran into each other at school, even tough I had never seen her there before.\\nFriday evening was halloween night, so I was still tired saturday.\\n\\nThat saturday it was the infamous meetup. A mutual friend of me and my friend wanted to go out, since we were going to that meeting we told him he could join us, even tough he's not active on Twitter. CP let us know she and a friend were coming over soon, what? a friend? who invited her? You can't assume I have enough place to accomodate everyone. Because of that our mutual friend couldn't join, but that was no big deal.\\nI had to be home at 2 AM and felt like it would be late enough already around these people. So we're drinking and talking at different bars. Around quarter over 1 I tell CB that we're about to leave since we have to get the car and it's still a half hour drive. She tells us she's going to greet everyone. After 30 minutes waiting outside and talking to others, we get in to look for her. She was still talking and didn't feel pressured at all. We told everyone goodbye within 2 minutes and left.\\n\\nWhile walking to the car, CB's friend really had to pee. Are you fucking kidding me? We've been at bars ALL NIGHT! She's theatening to wet the car if she can't find a toilet. OMG, I'm mad and get the car meanwhile, while complaining to my friend. We leave the village at 2 AM.\\n\\nAs I'm on the highway and realize it's still 20 minutes till my friends home I ask them if it's fine to drop them there aswell, they can now call a taxi if they like. Withing the captial regeon, Taxi's are quite cheap. But the capital is also concidered dangerous, especially if you live in another city.. Which is totally exaggerated, especailly at 3 AM at the first exit of the highway. As we arrive the taxi's already waiting, and called to ask where they are. The friend asks if I needed money for the petrol. My parents pay it, so I don't mind, but since I was outraged I asked €10. All good I think and drive home, 10 minutes later I get in bed, 1 hour later than expected. (Besides, €10 is the student wage for one hour work, which is a perfect compensation. Also, the car is around €50k, devided by 200k km, multiplied by the traveled distance is also €10, so it's still justifiable)\\n\\nSo the next day there was a huge discussion on Twitter, I didn't notice until someone asked me about it in a Direct Message. I had no idea what this was all about and decided to ask CB, to my astonishment she blocked me. What? Well appearantly I dropped 2 young girls in the middle of the capital, a VERY dangerous city and they were unsafe. I am amazed, most people don't care or don't see what this was all about, some girls think I'm the devil, but I don't mind.</td>\n",

One afternoon I was picked up by a friendly older Kiwi. It turned out his business is consulting for struggling hostels, so he very frequently meets travelers like me and picks up hitch hikers. He has traveled the country dozens of times. On the way to my destination he went out of his way to take me to some cool thermal pools and pretty sights. It was great, because I likely would have just passed straight by them if anybody else had picked me up. \\n\\nHe was going on a speaking tour over the next week. Shortly before arriving at my destination he said, \"It's too bad your not going to this other way with me next instead. I could show you this spot and that. And I could get you free accomodation in these towns.\" Since he had been so friendly, and because I wanted to be open to fun new experiences and people, I decided spur of the moment to change my plan and keep traveling with him instead. \\n\\nI stay in his hotel room with him that night. He got us both dinner with the food budget he had from his employer. He then suggested we buy some alcohol, and asks if I don't mind paying since he got dinner. I had planned on giving up drinking at this point in my trip to save money, but I was happy to since he was being so nice and helpful to me. I bought a couple bottles of wine that got polished off pretty fast. And he ended up sharing a lot of whiskey that he had brought, so he was definitely giving back more than he was asking. We probably stayed up till 2 in the morning drinking, and had some great conversation.\\n\\nThe next day we move on to the next city, and basically repeat the night before. I buy a couple bottles of wine, and he very insistently makes me take a couple whiskey shots. At this point his personality is really starting to grate on me, but I figure it would be rude to leave early when he is expecting me to keep traveling with him for a couple more days.\\n\\nDay 3, while we're driving he straight up calls me out for not being appreciative enough of him. In particular, he said that I should be making more of an effort to buy food or drinks. He was mad at me that he had to ask me to buy the wine, and that I wasn't pushing to do so myself. His reasoning is that I should be spending whatever money I am saving by not staying in a hostel on things that we can enjoy. He frequently hosts couch surfers, and says that is standard practice when somebody provides you with a place to stay. But I actually spent more money traveling with him than I would have without. And it seemed unfair to expect we should each contribute equally, because I had almost no money and he had kept bragging about how much money he was making from each of his speaking engagements. This pretty much spelled the end of traveling together for me, and I hitched another ride while he was in one of his speaking engagements. He never responded to my message when I told him what I was doing. \\n\\nEver since I've been worrying about this general situation. I'm very stingy with what I allow myself to buy.

       "      <td>So this happened on reddit itself, and I'm not sure of the policy of posting reddit links, but I'll take a shot at it anyway. \\n\\nBasically what happened was that the commenters were discussing this occurrence, and somewhere below I saw a comment which said, \\n&amp;gt;I know that ultimately, the poor kid shouldn't be bullied over his backpack, but you ever see that episode of King of the Hill where Hank refuses to let Bobby become a husky boy model and pulls him out of a fashion show at the mall just in time to avoid having a nearby group of teenagers pelt the models with donuts? Then Bobby has a revelation and realizes how spot on Hank is and thanks him?\\nI feel like that's what's missing here- a Dad who just puts his foot down and tells him \"No, I'm sorry, but you're not taking that to school. You can hate me now, but trust me, you'll thank me for this later.\"\\n\\nI personally disagreed with some aspects of the comment, so I thought to write a reply with my opinion on it. Granted, at this point, I had no negativity toward the commenter at all, and in fact was looking for a conversation:\\n&amp;gt;That's a backward logic that should have no place in school. A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants; if you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such. Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.\\n\\nLooking back, I can see how it may have came across as rude or \"attacky\". In any case, he responded back:\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;That's a backward logic that should have no place in school.\\n\\n&amp;gt;When have public schools ever anything operate on anything but backwards logic?\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants\\n\\n&amp;gt;Yes, the my little pony backpack is total analogous to women not being allowed to wear pants.*Totally.*\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;f you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? \\n\\n&amp;gt;You should probably tell me I'd tell blacks to get to the back of the bus too, drama queen.\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such.\\n\\n&amp;gt;Letting your son wear a My Little Pony backpack to school? Yes, I totally agree.\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.\\n\\n&amp;gt;Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine.\\n\\nI realized at this point that I may have come across as overbearing, so replied trying to clear it up: \\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;That's a backward logic that should have no place in school.\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;When have public schools ever anything operate on anything but backwards logic?\\n\\n&amp;gt;Many times? Institutions which were influenced by feminist and womens rights groups dared to incorporate into their policy that women should be allowed to wear typically male clothing. \\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yes, the my little pony backpack is total analogous to women not being allowed to wear pants.*Totally.*\\n\\n&amp;gt;The logic used in both scenarios is most definitely comparable. I am by no means trying to compare the severity of both situations. \\n\\n\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;f you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? \\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;You should probably tell me I'd tell blacks to get to the back of the bus too, drama queen.\\n\\n&amp;gt;..Woah there, did I hit a bone with you? Never did I accuse you personally of anything, and if you read that as so, I am telling you now that I wrote that comment without any emotion directed toward you. If you have a problem with my comment, direct it to my words and not me personally. If you wish to continue to make this personal, then I have no interest in this conversation. \\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such.\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Letting your son wear a My Little Pony backpack to school? Yes, I totally agree.\\n\\n&amp;gt;In many schools, no bullying would result from this. Sometimes wearing \"goth\" clothing and makeup can get both girls and boys bullied in school, but that shouldn't force a parent to absolutely prohibit their children from wearing a certain kind of look. \\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.\\n\\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine.\\n\\n&amp;gt;As I said, there are places where no bullying would occur as a result of this. In any case, even if you do desire to put slight blame and criticism onto the mother, that is an entirely different subject. The school as a governmental entity should direct the punishing to the perpetrators. If a girl wearing a miniskirt is raped by a classmate, the classmate should be punished and not the girl. As I said, I am not comparing the severity of these situations, but the reality is that the logic used to arrive to both conclusions is similar, and both are examples of victim-blaming. We don't live in a society where people are punished for increasing their chances of being a victim, and a school which runs because of the government should follow similar principles of righteousness. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis whole exchange went on and on until it became more personal. At this point, I don't want to bring more of a quote mountain than I already have, so [here] (www.np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/20odnl/tw_not_tumblr_9_year_old_is_banned_from_wearing_a/cg61ebk) is a permalink to the rest of the conversation. This is the point he begun calling me a piece of shit and to fuck off, and I was a bit shaken. I likely commented back too harshly as well. \\n\\nWhat do you think?

       "      <td>So, I live in a college neighborhood. I was just leaving my apartment to go to the grocery store, and I get to a \"T\" in the road. The other car, a pretty new-looking silver Audi, is driving down the straight part. I'll admit I wasn't 100% attentive at this moment, but I also think the Audi was going a bit too fast for being in a parking lot. There was no stop sign where I was, it was a situation where I was supposed to yield. I judged that the car was far enough away that I had time to make the turn, so I did. The Audi got really close to my car while I turned and had to stop. I knew I fucked up--I was pretty embarrassed so I didn't look to see the driver's face, but I could tell out of the corner of my eye that he wasn't happy. I thought \"Oh well, at least it's over. What's the worst that could happen, he follows me?\" (Which I never thought would actually happen. When this happened, he was driving in the opposite direction from where I was headed. This means he actually made an effort to stop and turn around.)\\n\\nFast forward about five minutes. I parked at the grocery store. I was grabbing my stuff to get out of the car, and I heard a knock on the window. I was about to get out anyway, so I opened the door. It was someone I didn't recognize. He starts to say, \"Next time, learn how to drive!\"\\n\\nI immediately realized who it was, and I said, \"You followed me here...?!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, you almost did some serious damage to my car. I live at--I actually work at [apartment complex], and I just don't wanna see people around there driving like that.\"\\n\\n\"I'm really sorry...what do you want me to say? Nothing happened. I'll admit I wasn't paying full attention. I'm really sorry. I don't know what else to say.\"\\n\\nAt this point, I was really freaked out. I figured if this guy followed me, he was at least a little crazy...but after that he pretty much accepted my apology and went on his way. I feel like I should mention that while he got out of his car to talk to me, he left his car parked in the middle of the parking lot. The incident had me pretty shook up for the rest of the day. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and it's people like this who are the reason why I don't like to leave my apartment often. I told my roomies about it later, and we wondered, how far would he have followed me? What if I was driving to the other side of town? This happened a couple days ago, and I've been terrified of running into him again ever since. \\n\\nIn my opinion, if you're so worried about your fancy car being damaged, don't bring it to a college neighborhood full of inexperienced drivers.\\n</td>\n",

When we returned to our house I swapped out bills because she owed me some money for gas (don't mind spending money on her, just when money gets tight I sometimes need it back), while she was in the shower. I told her when she got out that I had done so and she seemed a little upset. Later she tells her parents that she gave me some for helping. When I went over to their house to see them after they got back the first thing her step-dad does is dive into the same talks about our finances, like he always does, literally every time we are there he asks about my finances. I got fed up and left because I don't give a shit what her step-dad thinks about what I do with my money. Anyway I'm driving home when my gf calls crying. I tell her to calm down because I don't want her to get in a wreck. We get home and talk about what her parents said. Basically they said I control her and that I'm manipulative. Her step-dad called me a \"pussy\" because I walked out and that I'm never allowed back over to their house. Turns out she told her mom I took the money out of her purse. She did explain that I was getting paid back but it was no use. I realized now why they were so upset, she told her mom the night it happened and I didn't know that until about 3 or 4 days after the whole incident at their house. When she talked to her mom about the whole thing her mom will get over it but her step-dad basically said he doesn't want me over here etc. All I want out of the situation is an apology for all the name calling and being talked down to.

Bonnie and I have been, as the story starts out, romantically involved for less than 5 months.\\n\\nI have the ability and tools to do certain jobs that Annie and Bonnie need done. Annie wants to compensate me (which I tried to dissuade her from doing, but she insisted) but Annie doesn't have the cash she thinks the work is worth. Instead, at Bonnie’s suggestion, Annie offers to trade a vehicle worth roughly what the jobs are worth. This vehicle used to belong to her deceased son (Bonnie’s brother). It had also at that time sat idle for nearly 4 years. Because I like the vehicle and have the ability to bring it back to operating order, plus want to keep Annie happy, I accept the offer.\\n\\nAfterward, Annie tells me that she preferred that the vehicle not go to Bonnie after I suggested that she drive it when she wanted (Annie said she was concerned about safety, as it’s a bit top-heavy, not a hardtop, and has nothing but a basic seatbelt). I then find that Bonnie has been really wanting the vehicle anyway, even though she knew of her mother’s objections. At this point I begin to suspect that Bonnie’s running a scheme to get the vehicle despite her mother’s wishes, but since it’s just a suspicion and otherwise we’re having a great relationship, I let it go.\\n\\nI complete just about everything that Bonnie needed, plus some other things that come up incidentally. In the meantime, I’ve spent a good bit of money and time getting the vehicle back into operating order and making a few improvements. The jobs I need to do for Annie require that one or both of them be present or allow me access to out-of-town property. I complete a couple of days’ worth and then something weird happens. Every opportunity that I have to work for Annie, Bonnie has convinced her to take a daytrip, or some other distraction, or gives me conflicting information regarding the arrangements that keeps me from being able to complete the work. Bonnie goes quiet when I ask about this phenomenon, and our relationship falters.\\n\\nDespite what I feel are one-sided efforts on my part to discuss these and other issues, our relationship starts to cool at the 10-11 month mark. I make the split, finally and at the time amicably, after 14 months, with Bonnie bemoaning our “lack of communication” and telling me that only she knows what her mother REALLY wants/needs, and states that my understanding of Annie’s clear language is severely flawed. Due to this and other factors, some of the jobs that Annie needed done did not get done. I don’t feel comfortable contacting Annie directly and risking coming between her and her daughter (they’re basically the only family each of them have left in the local area).\\n\\nA couple of months after we split, Bonnie contacts me on Facebook, requesting that I give the vehicle to her. Due to the abusive nature of her language I do not reply, but instead block her on Facebook and from calling or texting me. I have not blocked any communication from Annie, however, but have yet to hear anything at all from her. If they can maintain a good relationship by both hating me, I’m OK with that, even though I still regard Annie very highly.\\n\\nI do not live/work/travel through the areas they are in, so it’s not likely that they will see the vehicle. Besides, I have altered it’s appearance in various ways, and I don’t feel that they would immediately recognize it if they did happen to see it. Just to throw one more factor in, it currently needs a major repair to the transmission that, according to mechanics much better than I, is likely due to the long time sitting idle.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\n**TL/DR; I've got my ex-GF's dead brother's car that her mother gave to me, and the ex wants me to give it to her.**</td>\n",

Even when I did, I was rarely given praise for it, other than a short 'well done' or 'good'. Basically I was expected to be a 'good little girl' and just do what I was told. \\n  \\n  Then there's my cousin. He basically never tried at school and left at 16 with close to nothing to show for it. He was also, and still is to some extent, allowed to do as he pleased. He just seemed content to sit on his bum, collect his unemployment money and just generally laze his life away. Any attempt to speak with him about going to college and getting some qualifications (I wasn't the one speaking to him to clarify.) or about applying for work was met with 'dunno' or 'I'm looking at a course' or 'I'm speaking to a mate' or some other lazy excuse. \\n  \\n  So skip forward to two weeks ago and a family member mentions that she's heard from someone she knows that there is this job going which my cousin should be 'perfect' to do. Stuff happens, calls get made and abraadabra, my cousin gets the job, no effort required on his part.\\n\\n  Now part of the problem I have with the whole thing is that the same help wasn't exactly forthcoming when it came to my own jobsearching, and if anything I was made to feel quite a shitty, horrible failure of a human being by my family for it. There were times when things devolved into screaming matches (not instigated by myself for the most part) because of it. \\n\\n Rather it was the situation that it was down to my effort, despite my family, to find jobs, to post CVs to companies, to secure interviews and then to finally secure the job I now have. All of it was because I put in real effort and actually did something. \\n\\n  Another part of me also feels resentment because I know that my cousin isn't the person my family thinks he is. They think he's this wonderful innocent kid, and that he's somehow on a pedestal because he'll do a few odd jobs for them now and again. Yet I've seen the other side of him for myself and I know he's just playing the goodie two-shoes act so he'll get the praise (and money/favours) from them. \\n\\n So, am I being an asshole or not here?</td>\n",

To make a long story short, when his pass gets rejected from the scanner on the second day, it turned out that the mountain only gave him a one day pass while I got the two day that we both thought we had.  He had the receipt and they did only charge him for the one day lift ticket, so I'm assuming the ticket people just misheard him or hit the wrong button or something.  Obviously this would be a total pain in the ass for anyone, but you would have sworn it was the worst thing that had happened to him in the past year.  He threw a goddamn fit in the lift line.  Me, being a little bitch for some reason (probably too nervous about confronting a friend, especially with a 4-5 hour drive in front of us), didn't really say anything.  I kind of passively agreed with everything he was going on about as if I was only half paying attention.  I somehow got dragged in to his plan to go confront the service desk.  He did all the talking while I just kind of sheepishly sat there and presented my own lift ticket when he asked.  They didn't reimburse him.  Instead, he would have had to buy a second one day pass which would have been about $20 more total than just getting the two day pass in the first place.  In a final act of angry principal he refused to buy the ticket and starts heading to the car to leave.  I guess he expected me to go with him but seeing as how I paid full price and wanted to ride the entire second day (this was at like 10:30), I told him that I was going to stay and ride.  He ended up staying in his car (he drove us) for a few hours while I stayed on the mountain.  I did come back earlier than I would have otherwise, but I'm sure it was still boring as fuck for him.  One thing I will say though, is that he had really been being a jerk for the entire trip.  He had bitched about everything from how far the restaurant was from where we were staying, to the people we shared the lift with to how much this mountain sucked compared to the ones he normally goes to.  If he hadn't had been such a dick for the past two days I would have been willing to compromise or help him out in some way, but at this point I wasn't feeling too generous towards him.\\n\\nThe ride back was pretty awkward.\\n\\n\\n\\nWas I the asshole?</td>\n",

So I have been hanging out with this girl exclusively with another guy who is a senior(18) I had asked her before we hung out the first time to go to a movie with me and about a month later to my birthday which was also a movie. She said yes to both of these and then about a day before said something like Oh sorry I have &amp;lt;some excuse&amp;gt; I'm so sorry I can't go. This annoyed, me after the second time I was thinking about confronting her but decided against it because if by some chance these were legitimate wouldn't want to be the fool who accused her.

Even if this is meant to be satirical I don't find it funny and have had to deal with this in order to hang out with her. I texted her one day that I wanted to get lunch with her on&amp;lt;day&amp;gt; and what she thought, she responded no less than 5 mins later saying how much fun we'd have and how she'd love to go(some additional info: we had a school performance(8-10:30AM) that morning followed by the banquet that following afternoon(6-12PM)) I said I'd meet her or pick her up to go to the restaurant at 12.

       "      <td>Some background: We've known each other for almost 5 years now, but didn't really become close friends until around a year ago. She is extremely rational/logical and hates inefficiency and incompetence (INTJ, for those who know MBTI), while I'm more of a sensitive idealist who tries to avoid conflict (INFJ).\\n\\nThis has resulted in some clashes of values in the past, but in general we get along quite well.\\n\\n----\\nToday I had heard about enneagrams (a personality indicator) from another friend, and thought it was pretty cool so I shared it with her through a text, asking her what her results were on the test. She didn't reply, so I assumed she was busy and resumed studying for exams. \\n\\nA few hours later, she responds with \"Apparently I'm majoring in entrepreneurship\". I was pretty distracted from studying, not really remembering what we were talking about, and so I assumed she was talking about school and not enneagrams. \\n\\n*It's important to note that enneagram results are portrayed as numbers from 1 to 9, they don't have anything to do with majors, which is relevant for the next part.\\n\\nI was pretty confused because she's majoring in chemical engineering, not entrepreneurship, so I told her she should probably talk to her counselor and get it changed. \\n\\nShe responded with \"Sigh, never mind\" and I realized I was probably missing something important, so I asked her what I missed, and she told me \"Don't worry about it.\" \\n\\nAt this point I was pretty frustrated because I'm a curious person, so I told her that what she's doing is making me even more curious. I'm assuming that she was getting frustrated as well, because she responded with \"Good, go suffer\"\\n\\nAfter a few very confused minutes, I looked back and realized that she was probably talking about the results of her enneagram test, and I expressed this revelation by saying \"OH YOU TOOK THE TEST I GET IT, MAN I'M SLOW\". She responded \"Sigh. Sometimes I wonder about you\"\\n\\nNow I didn't think this was very nice, because given the context of being in college plus the fact that I was distracted made me think that she was, in fact, talking about college in her text, and so I explained this to her. \\n\\nShe replied with \"I don't know why I bother\"\\n\\nI didn't think her treatment of me throughout this entire exchange was fair at all (especially given the fact that she assumed/implied that I was stupid because at first I misunderstood her text, despite my explanation of the misunderstanding to her), so I told her \"You're judging others by their actions and judging yourself by your intentions\"\\n\\nShe then gave me the cold shoulder and said \"Have a good rest of the night\"\\n\\nSorry about the wall of text, but after reading all of that am I the asshole in this situation? I really don't know what I did wrong.\\n\\n----\\n**TL;DR:** Told a friend her behavior towards me was unfair by saying \"You're judging others by their actions and judging yourself by your intentions\" and she responds with \"Have a good rest of the night\" and proceeds to ignore me. Am I the asshole?\\n\\nEDIT: After talking it out with people similar to her on the /r/INTJ subreddit, I decided to just forgive and forget. We hung out today and everything's fine; neither one of us brought it up. Thanks for the help everyone!</td>\n",

Then, for some reason, I argue with various users about why I think Humble Bundle is still a good place. I probably should have just let it go, but I really found it weird that people legitimately were HATING on Humble Bundle. I never thought it was a bad thing, I get some bundles from there and they usually have great value and I get to decide where the money goes (developers, charity, or humble bundle).\\n\\nWhat I didn't expect was to be downvoted so heavily (my top comment is now positive, but the rest are very negative and even that top comment is highly controversial in terms of up/down and it isn't Reddit's algorithm, as it was at -14 earlier).\\n\\nPeople have even begun to accuse me of being a Humble Bundle employee (I'm not).

We already had a history of not being super nice to each other, as I see her bossing my roommate around all the time (none of my business I know) but this day pushed her to almost full out hatred of me.  We had a table for over ten people and they are sitting across from me.  The meal goes fine until we get the bill.  The waitress hands out pens for the receipts since we all payed by card.  We all get similar pens except for her, she gets one of the nicest pens I have ever seen.  This thing had heft and mass, and wrote like a dream (I borrowed it after she used it to sign my receipt). It looked almost exactly like [this](http://static1.jetpens.com/images/a/000/006/6234.jpg).  As we are about to leave she starts talking to her sister about taking the pen.  I overhear this and mention that they shouldn't take the pen, they in no way need it and the waitress is just working to support herself.  I work part time at a restaurant and see first-hand how hard waitstaff works and see how in their stressful job how something small can push them emotionally.  My buddy's girl snaps at me right away saying, \"My mom would think it's just fine\" in the the absolute rudest way possible.  Not wanting to get into family business or anything I do not mention her comment, but do ask her to picture herself as the waitress paying for bills, school, etc with this job.  In the same tone as before she quick retorts, \"My dad would would take it too.\"  At this point, I'm ready to leave and I see her stashing it away in her purse and I casually mention to her that I think her and her parents are thieves and get up to leave.  She does not take kindly to this, and makes a fuss about needing to leave right away.  I am exiting the building and still see her still making a fuss about whatever she was talking about to everyone else.

I left $20 in its place with a note that said, \"Collateral\". \\n\\nFast forward 2 weeks later, he decides he's going to Orlando. I quickly tell him of what happened and offered to give him way more weed than I took to bring with him, plus the $20 cause I felt bad. He flipped his shit and made a scene and said he left it up there so he wouldn't have to drive with it. Very valid point, but I found out later he brought up weed anyway, but just denied my offers, and still took the $20. When he came back he was still mad and told all of our mutual friends and our parents. Said that the $20 didn't mean shit.\\n\\nThat's the story. First off let me say that I understand it was very wrong for me to take something that wasn't mine, which is why I apologized profusely and offered him reimbursement plus the $20. Still received a shit storm though. Why do you guys think? What if it happened to you?

Everybody but a couple living there was on the lease, and we didn't think this would be an issue as we had all been friends for 3 years we trusted everyone in the house, blah blah blah.  I should also note that had this couple not agreed to live with us we would not have rented the house due to the rent.  \\n    Cue the summer, we still have several months on the lease and everyone is graduating and moving on or looking for new jobs.  The couple decides that they dont want to live at our place anymore and sign a new lease for the summer without telling anyone.  They then tell us that they are going to move out and cant afford to pay rent at both places.  According to them this is ok though because they saved us money by agreeing to move into the house with us so rent would be split between more people.  I am not going to start a bunch of petty fights while we still have to live together because they are already locked into the new lease and we have no real legal recourse to make them pay rent so I remain civil until they move out, but everyone is pretty pissed off.  \\n    After they move out I stop answering their calls and texts because I no longer want to be friends with someone who pulls that move.  A week after they move out the female in the relationship is blowing up my phone and I ignore her calls.  She calls my roommate who is nicer than me and he answers and says he doesnt know why I would be ignoring her calls as that is between us two.  She texts me and asks why I am ignoring her.

I don't have to smoke with you at all, ya know.\"\\n\\nSo anyways, he agrees that I can get a pinch for myself tonight.

He tells me, \"oh my grandpa told me to come home for dinner.\" I ask him if he dropped the weed off at Jackson's, because my house is on the way from Jackson's to Billie's. Yup. He stopped by Jackson's. Then he came clean and just said, \"I forgot lol.\"  Nope. He stayed at Jackson's for an house and a half, getting stoned and drove home completely forgetting to stop by my place. \\n\\nI'm just annoyed at this whole situation. This type of thing happens a lot with a lot of other things not including weed. I never ask to keep any of his stuff, he is actually the one who asks to keep some of my weed for himself. I say yes sometimes depending on what I have. I don't let him walk all over me, I just feel like if I'm gonna be a bro to you, be a bro back. And if you're gonna drive by my house without a second glance, at least text me.

I work more hours than everyone.  Show up first, leave late, etc.  The office has an air conditioning system which I turn on and set to 72º every morning.  We don't run it at night.  It's in New England and humid as fuck, so when you come in early, the place is dripping wet making it easy to feel uncomfortable at 70º when you always have to wear a coat and long pants.  But after an hour of dehumidifying, 72º is fine.  A co-worker of mine who only comes in once a week (and usually late) comes in dressed in designer clothes fit for going to the beach on a hot day and announces that it's too cold in here.  I can't wear less and be dressed appropriately, and management isn't going to take the risk of criticizing a woman's fashion choices.   I told her to wear a freaking sweater and left the AC on.  *Am I the Asshole?*\\n\\n**TL;DR: I adjust the AC to make it comfortable in work-appropriate clothes.  My co-worker wants the whole office hotter so she can dress like she's outside in the summer.**\n",

           I have been on a parking structure project for about 1 year and 3 months. People keep asking me when it will be completed and why it's taking so long. I am merely a foreman(assistant) on this job. I am very fed up with these questions and not completing it as well. I have started to vary my answer to 3 months plus a year for other new construction but that doesn't concern the opening as much. Or my other answers are laugh it off or get pissed, but don't give a direct answer. Am I an asshole for being so bitter over this project? \\n\\nIt's hard writing unbiased. \n",

                                 My parents are diabetic, morbidly obese, and addicted to food. \\n\\nI'm the same, minus the diabetes. I've been trying for a while to eat healthily and lose weight. So have they, but yet every time they go to the store, they bring home junk food. \\n\\nI understand that it's hard for them, but it's also hard to stay on track with my healthier lifestyle when there's junk food all around me. Plus, they're getting older, so it is crucial for them to get healthy now.\\n\\n\\nA few weeks ago, they brought home 4 bags of donuts, and I emptied each pack into the trash. Am I an asshole for this?\\n\\n**Edit:** I love all the responses. Got one \"no\", one \"maybe\", and one \"yes\". I agree with all of you.\\n\\n**Edit 2:** You guys are right--I'm the asshole.\n",

                             I love the musical *Les Miserables*. A coworker of mine said that they didn't like it. I asked why and they said, among other things, that \"it's not a musical, it's an opera.\"\\n\\nNow, I happen to be an opera singer. I told them adamantly that it is NOT an opera. There are a number of things that make this true, but if you can take my word for it- and I hope you can- it's not a matter of opinion whether a mainstream musical is an opera or not. It is a musical, period.\\n\\nMy coworker thought otherwise. \"My boyfriend writes musicals and he agrees with me\" was the extent of her argument. Well, he may well write musicals but that doesn't mean he knows anything about opera. You might as well ask a jazz pianist to tell you about Beethoven- it's not the same area of expertise even if it's related. I told her \"You're entitled to your opinion even if it's wrong\" in a sort-of joking way. Maybe I was being dickish.\\n\\nI gotta know- am I the asshole?\n",

I live at home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and younger sister.\\n\\nThe hours my team and I play are between 6pm and 12am every night, although not for 6 hours continuously; it may be 9pm till 12am, or 6pm till 10pm, etc. and obviously I'm talking during those hours. Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\\n\\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\\n\\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this, all because I game competitively and am trying to win money from winning events?\n",

her to the point where he wants to be exclusive with her. Girl goes behind his back, makes him out to be the bad guy to my second friend and hooks up with him. After that she gets with around seven others. I knew about her going behind the back, my friend doesn't. I grew to resent the girl because I felt a bit betrayed, never broke the news to my friend about it though. Now she's his girlfriend, he's cut ties with me as a result because he knows that I don't agree with the relationship. Because of this, I don't only not see him, I don't see any of my other friends because he's cut ties with the ones that know what I know and we do not get together anymore. Small disclaimer: I'm good friends with the girl but keep quiet about the whole thing to prevent any issue.\\n\\nAITA?\n",

Last week I spent Tuesday through Friday out of town and got home at about 8 pm Friday. Saturday my girlfriend had a meeting at 11 Am and it was supposed to be a couple hours, she went out with a coworker till about 11 pm when I picked her up and drove her home. I knew where she was, and I knew who she was with, I was a bit frustrated that I never got an invite, and I was annoyed that so much of our finite amount of time that we're home together was wasted. Instead of saying \"hey how bout you come home\" I just waiting thinking she'd show up at some point. We got in an argument about it then I went to bed. I feel like I am the asshole. \n",

        His name is Scoop. \\n\\nOver the two years I have worked for this coffee shop, he has told us our store or another store has made his drink wrong, or he spilled it, returning to us an empty cup, or nothing at all. He then asks to have another one.\\n\\nHe is sixty. He flirts with all the young (20-30s) women who wait in line. \\n\\nHe had a one minute conversation with my mother once in line and now asks me every time, \"How is the family?\" as if he knows me. \\n\\nHe chats up all of the wealthy businessmen who come in. \\n\\nI permanently give him decaf. Am I the asshole? \n",

Last year, Jen was in level 3 french, and I was in level 2 french, but I challenged the final exam and was booted up to level 3. \\n\\nFrom the day I entered her class, she seemed to really not like me. She would speak to me very condescendingly, and make it clear with faces and noises that she didn't want to sit near me if it happened to end up that way. She never actively tried to be mean, but she passive-aggressively made it clear that I was not welcome. \\n\\n\\nThis year, I continued to French 4, and she did not. It is a very very small class, of only about 7 people. One day, we were having a discussion about athletes moving from Highschool to University, where they are suddenly not the top scorer anymore. \\n\\nI, being impulsive and bold, wondered aloud \"Was Jen top in her french class?\" Prof looked at me funny, and I said \"She never seemed to like me. I was wondering if  she was top in the class.\" Prof said she didn't know, and that was the end of it. At least, until I got on facebook that evening. I am the purple, and she is the green.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/5JIXVxC\\n\\nAm I the asshole for talking about her? And yes, It is superficial drama, but it's been bugging me, especially because her message was slightly frightening. I haven't yet seen her besides a quick passing.\n",

My first roommate dropped out in October, and I got a new one to start he 2nd semester. He's the worst. Here's some of the undesirable qualities about him.\\n\\n* Incredible snoring. I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven't approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was \"have you told him about your snoring??\" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It's too loud not to know. This is fine, you can't help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I'm not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point...\\n\\n* He's a lazy fuck. He's very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it's because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn't do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn't help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality..\\n* He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn't stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a \"stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3\". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn't even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it.\\n\\nTonight though, I thought about something. I am talking about him a lot. I mean, he gives me a lot to talk about. However, I feel like I may be just as bad as he is, talking about him and the things he does with my friends and floormates behind his back. So, am I the asshole? Am I the asshole for talking about him so much and making such a big deal out of him, or is he simply the asshole and I'm responding to that?\\n\n",

section, got the nosebleed seats around center ice about 6 rows from the top.  It was against our rivals, so the seats were packed.  Every time the action came around the boards on our side, I had to stand up to see what was happening.  I also stood when we got close to scoring a goal.  The people behind me were pissed that I kept standing up and told me to just watch what was happening on the jumbotron.  My thoughts were that if I wanted to sit down and watch the game on a screen, I would have stayed at home and watched from my couch.  What are your thoughts; am I the asshole?\n",

She treats him like shit and a bitch while he continues to tell us that he's in love and that they are perfect for each other. She is also a Debbie Downer and will never mind her own business which causes me and many of our mutual friends to dislike her a lot, however despite that fact I decided to be friendly towards her in order to keep my friend happy and her not so much of a problem. \\n\\nCut to a month or two ago when he is begging a bunch of our friends to let her come to a music festival with us because he promised her he would go with her without getting a place to stay. We do not like this idea at all but he just will not back down. He is so persistent about it that I finally snap and tell him that the reason she cannot come with is is because I hate her. Well this makes him riled up so he goes and tells his girlfriend the entire story. After that she would refuse to talk to me and wouldn't hang out with our group when I'm around, and wherever she goes he goes. \\n\\nCut to today where tells me it isn't fair she cannot hang out with our group, but my girlfriend is (she is very well liked by my friends.) We get to talking and he tells me to apologize to his girlfriend for making her feel bad because I \"pretended to be her friend,\" and I refused. Am I the asshole?\n",

She was always a bit clumsy, destroyed several things such as cups and drinking glasses. However I of course didn't mind because we were friends. I also didn't mind that several times I had an appointment with her and took a long trainride to get to her and she wasn't there. then she realized I had more than just one friend and became super jealous. She insulted my friends very badly, called me a bad friend when I went on holidays with someone else. And many other things. At some point our friendship died...\\n\\nSeveral months later, xmas 2012, we invited our families and needed 8 wine glasses. But we had just 7 .. because she had destroyed one. I was so angry because this made me remember her and what she did. So I sent her a very insulting SMS. Because I wanted her to feel bad on xmas too.\\n\\nAnother few months later, something else happened - I actually don't remember - that made me angry about her again. I sent another VERY insulting SMS.\\n\\nNow she sued me and won. I have to pay a more than 900$ penalty.\\n\\nShe's got borderline, which of course explains EVERYTHING she's done. I just wasn't capable of handling that anymore at some point.\\n\\nI feel like I had the \"right\" to insult her after all she's done and of course all my friends say I'm right. But I'm really worried that I am the actual asshole after all...\\n\\ntl;dr: Girl destroyed wine glass. Later we stopped being friends. Later I needed a wine glass and sent her an insulting SMS because it was missing. AItA?\n",

          Door to door sales person came to my door around 9:15pm trying to peddle some attic insulation and asking if I've received my rebate.

I was full so I gave the rest to one of my friends and said he could keep them. A few hours later we were at the fountain that's outside the Louvre and the Arc that isn't the Arc de Triumf, it's like the red granite looking one with like a gold chariot on it. Anyway I was like hey can I have some of those peanuts, and my \"friend\" was like \"No way dude you gave those to me.\" I didn't have any other food so I was like wtf, can I have like one of your protein bars or something and he was like no, I was like are you fucking kidding me and grabbed his backpack as collateral for a handful of peanuts, and he was like fine take your fucking peanuts AND THREW THEM IN THE FOUNTAIN. I gave his backback back so that I wouldn't make more of a scene. His excuse was that he carried this bag of peanuts which weighed maybe 5 ounces. He is adamant that he was in the right and I was out of line, so did the other friend I was with, I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone, so tell me am I the asshole?\n",

A lot of it comes down to us being from different cultures, but most of my well-intended mistakes have been interpreted as offensive. I do get along with my aunt &amp; uncle-in-law and they've attempted to stick up for me to my in-laws.\\n\\nMy cousin-in-law is getting married in a few weeks. I get along with her but I'm not close to her. I've been dreading the wedding because interactions with my in-laws are always very stressful.\\n\\nA month ago, my mom was diagnosed with extremely aggressive breast cancer. She's stage 4 with type 4 lymphoma. While the doctors have a lot of optimism, there's a very real chance it could be fatal. The doctors are rushing her into treatment before the cancer metastasizes. Her second chemo treatment, the \"bad one\" as the doctors call it, is the same day as my cousin-in-law's wedding.\\n\\nMy mom lives 400 miles away; my cousin-in-law is local.\\n\\nMy mom is terrified of the chemo. I planned on being there for all her chemo treatments since I telecommute and my boss has told me to be wherever I need to be in order to take care of my mom.\\n\\nLast night, my wife asked me what suit I plan on wearing to her cousin's wedding. I told her I'm not going because the wedding is the same weekend as one of my mom's chemo treatments and I need to be there for my mom. My wife told me she didn't use an excuse out of my cousin's wedding.\\n\\n[AITA] #1: I angrily replied my wife was being unfair because no one in her family was dying of cancer when my cousin was getting married.\\n\\n[AITA] #2: My wife replied my mom isn't dying, just very ill, so it would be selfish of me to take care of her. I told my wife she was being an asshole and walked away.\\n\\nI'm struggling with the ethics on this one. I believe taking care of sick family always comes first no matter whose side of the family is sick. Is that a wrong thing to believe?\n",

To do this, we typically arranged something via text message, which worked totally fine. \\n\\n  Anyway, the last time I saw her was in November, and admittedly she was, at the time anyway, busy with a number of commitments and problems that had come up. However, I have my own commitments including a job and voluntary events, and she was totally aware of this, as well as being aware that I was also similarly going through a number of issues of my own. It cannot have been an issue of time as she had more free time than I do and a lot more money than me too, despite being on welfare benefits and getting things like a house (something I would so desperately love) pretty much given to her. Then she meets me and whines about how terrible the house is or how she's bored sitting in the house all day, knowing fine and well I've got to work for the little money I earn. \\n\\n Anyway, we agreed in November that we'd try and meet in December, just before Christmas. When this didn't happen, I hoped that we could at least have a coffee before the New Year came round and I would be busy at work. In both cases it was always some excuse or another, and eventually New Year came without me hearing a single word from her. \\n\\n  So come the middle of January I rang her and asked her what was happening. She promised me **faithfully** that in two weeks time (the start of Febuary) she'd meet me. This, like the other previous times, she told me she couldn't meet me and it would be two weeks before she could meet me. I told her that she should ring me in a week and let me know what was happening, as I'd had some holidays booked from work and so was freer than usual to meet. \\n   \\n  I made a point of waiting until last week to give her some space, but when the usual promise of meeting in two week's time got trotted out, I gave her an ultimatum via text. I'll bulletpoint the texts in paraphrased fashion:\\n\\n* **Text 1**: Look, all I'm asking for is a date. I've got my work and I'm also bored of getting messed around, bearing in mind I'm being promised you'll meet me. \\n\\n*Her response: Yeah well I've got problems in my life and all I'm trying to do is be a good friend, and you're making demands of me and being horrible to me.*\\n\\n**Text 2**: Well yeah, I've got problems too. Also, you did stuff wrong too, and you seem more interested in yourself than anyone, despite you calling me a friend**\\n\\n*Her response: Well this is all your fault, you seem to think your whole life is dependent on me. Just go and do whatever you want, I don't care.*\\n\\n**Text 3 (final text)**: Surprise, surprise, it's my fault. Act like an adult, not a kid, and actually realise that you're not the centre of my life, and that you're acting like it's the end of the world because I actually want to know what's happening in my life, bearing in mind you're expecting me to spend good money on petrol and food. \\n\\n  This prompted a long, rambling phonecall (which I ignored for the most part) about how she 'wasn't friends with me any more' and how she hated me. Since then I haven't heard a word from her. \\n\\n  So, who is the asshole in this situation?\\n\\n\n",

I refer to them as  the \"junior girls\" because it's easier than listing off all of their names. When I was a freshman, my band class took our annual trip to Chicago. My best friend (let's just call him Shane) used to really like this girl (let's call her Hannah) who is in our grade and is good friends with the \"junior girls\". So last year he started hanging out with Hannah and the junior girls so that he could get closer to Hannah. The junior girls really took a liking to Shane, which made me jealous. He never admitted it until recently but he liked the attention he got from them. But back to my point, he totally left me in the dust while he ran off with Hannah and the junior girls. I spent the better part of my freshman year trying to get the junior girls' attention (which I regret wholeheartedly) and it failed. In fact, it ended up making me look even worse, and pathetic. Fast forward to the beginning of this year, where I apparently made Hannah mad in a way that I don't really recall (it was several months ago) which made her chew me up saying that I \"ruin friendships\" and that I'm \"one of the rudest people she's ever met.\" Which made the junior girls hate me even more. Looking back I realize how stupid I was for getting so jealous, it made me really depressed and nothing good came out of it. Reddit, was I the asshole? \n",

I'm taking a semester off and spending a month and a half of it at my parents house. This is the longest time that I have spent at their house in the past three and a half years for a slew of reasons. I usually only come home for a few days around holidays and then ship off back to school. I did not want to spend this much time at home, my parents basically bribed me back by paying my rent and bills for the month of February and March. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or unappreciative, I really appreciate their help, but I have been completely financially independent for the past three years and that is the way that I like it. I don't mind providing for myself and being responsible for myself financially, I actually prefer it because I don't feel obligated to other people. However, my parents were extremely adamant about me spending some time at home over my break. They don't fully understand my reasonings for taking this semester off and think that it's because I am unstable or something, which is untrue I simply needed a break like many students. Anyways, I've been here and been absolutely miserable. I hate the job that I'm working here and absolutely prefer the one at school. I don't have many friends here so I've been incredibly bored. Lastly, I have been fighting nonstop with my parents and just don't get along with my dad at all. Every conversation we have blows up into an unproportional argument involving tons of shit from the past and I end up saying really terrible things and feeling like a piece of shit. I try to avoid anything other than meaningless remarks about the t.v. show we're watching or how food tastes so this doesn't happen because I feel terrible constantly arguing with him when I'm in his home and he's paying for all of my stuff. But he keeps prying at things and me until I ultimately end up saying things that I really regret and feeling like an ungrateful piece of shit. Am I the asshole for just not wanting to come home at all because I knew that this is what it would be like or should I just suck everything up because they're paying for my shit?\n",

redditor (15) and this took place a year ago. We were sitting during lunch and this chick we use to hang out would usually give him her leftovers. So this day I asked her prior if I could have her leftovers, and she said ok. When I reminded her he was like \"dude what the fuck I asked her first\" and I told him how I asked prior and she gave me the leftovers. He flipped out and did this huge rant on how I'm a \"huge liar\" and how I lie so much (which wasn't true by the way, I pretty much only lied like a little kid normally would in 2nd grade.) and I think it was only to make me look bad; he left and moved as far away as possible. We haven't talked since. \\n\\nI don't know his side and I probably never will, but my speculation was that he may have liked the girl or something. \n",

Anyways me and my friend were talking to a new girl who hangs out with a group i normally only speak to every now and then. I tried to branch out and talk to them....and for about three days it went fine. One day my friend says to me \"Dude! your screwed he is mad at you.\" I asked him who it was and he replied. I am not saying his name for reasons.I literally said nothiing to him and he was already mad so i ask him he says \"I'm not mad.\" So I get mad at my friend thinking he lied and start cussing him then he says hes serious so i ask around the group they blow it off and say no. then the very next day he comes up to me and asks, \"why did you tell them?\" How would he know without me telling him? So now basicly that whole group hates me for no reason and my friend won't tell me why. We cuss and yell at each other for awhile but were okay now....I guess \n",

After I met her, I told my son (let's call him Tyler) that I thought Katie* was really sweet and smart and looked like she liked to eat.  Ok, I know that sounds bad, but Tyler's previous gf Dakota was borderline and refused to eat in front of anyone, and it always bothered me. I mean, if Tyler invites you over for a holiday meal, at least sit at the table and play with your food.  I guarantee no one would notice, but they will notice you sitting on the couch sulking.\\n\\nBut I digress, and I had to, to make the rest make sense.  About a year later, Tyler and Katie were hanging out here and he tells her what I said.  She looked kind of upset, and I know she thought I was making a comment about her weight, but I swear I wasn't.  I explained the whole Dakota situation, which she should've understood because she knew her and hated her with a passion.  I apologized, and explained what I meant.  I thought we were good.\\n\\nCut to **three** months later.  I'm at work and get a text from Katie's mom:  \"You're a fucking bully!  How dare you talk to an 18-year-old child like that.  You told my daughter she was a fat pig!\"\\n\\nWhat?  She texts back:  \"You're a sad pathetic cunt picking on a child.\"  This goes on and on.  I mean, I thought we were friends.  This literally came out of fucking nowhere!\\n\\nI tried to explain that I love to cook, and I love when people come over and they like to eat.  I really don't give a shit that the girl weighed 200 pounds.  Whatever.  My son loved her, so I loved her.\\n\\nSo am I an asshole for saying a girl looks like she likes to eat?\\n\\nEdit:  I forgot to mention that later on Katie's mom said she'd call the cops because I was harassing her.  I was ignoring most of her texts but at that point I texted her my address and said please, call the police.  Needless to say, she didn't.\n",

I'm the type of person that enjoys a quiet environment. I could stand some noise here and there, people talking around me, etc. But I cannot stand sharp noises like knocking on wood out coughing. I can tolerate it for a few minutes but when it's a constant thing throughout the day I it asks me so much.\\n\\nMy roommate does these type of noises constantly. He bands his fingers against a wooden bed frame all day. And he coughs every 10 minutes which makes me want to pull my hair out. It is a dry cough but he choughs with his mouth completely open without covering his mouth or trying to make it less noisy. I tried using earplugs and sound proof earphones and I could still hear it.\\n\\nI guess he caught a slight cold in these past couple of weeks because I like to leave the window open because it makes me sleep better but there window is closer to him so he felt more colder. \\n\\nSo I agreed to close it since he is sick with the condition that he tries t keep the finger banging (hehe) down and tries to make his coughs less apparent to me. He just told me that I'm just a jerk who complains to much. \\n\\nIs it too much to ask for though? Am I asshole for asking a sick roommate to keep down his coughing?\n",

The friendship ended with lots of (metaphorical) bloodshed, though in my defense, I was a high school freshman and afraid of having a direct confrontation. \\n\\nBasically, me and this chick M had been total best friends for about a year after I had moved to a new school. She was the first friend I made and being the insecure eighth-grader I had been I latched onto her like a cross between a leech and a member of a cult dedicated to her worship. \\n\\nIn the beginning, at least, she had been pretty much an ordinary best friend. She liked to draw, when we hung out around the school afterschool doing homework, she'd usually end up doodling something. She would always make a big game out of me not being able to see it until it's done (which was basically never since she's way too lazy to finish drawings), so I made a big game out of finding ways to dramatically steal it. It was like an inside joke between us.\\n\\nOur friendship was fine, until she slowly became obsessed with the idea of internet fame (mostly through her drawings or possibly her modeling). She made a bunch of internet friends through tumblr and would constantly be tweeting them and talking about them. She tried to make an effort to have me get to know them, though it felt more like showing her internet friends her irl groupies than trying to include me in her new group of friends.\\n\\nWe would still hang out, but she started expecting me to be constantly showering her with praise (which I had happily done without being asked in the past), but in return she would endlessly belittle me. \\n\\nHere's a conversation that I still vividly remember. The context is she was compiling info on a bunch of our friends in order to draw fanart of us in a Victoria's Secret alternate universe.\\n\\nM: Wow, your waist is (i don't remember the number) centimeters, that's twice as much as mine!\\n\\nme: Yeah, well my bigger boobs came at a price. (she's flat as a board and skinny as a toothpick)\\n\\nM: Yeah, well Behati only has 34B, so maybe yours are too big. Oh that reminds me in the VSAU, you obviously can't be a model. I think you'd make a good casting director though.\\n\\nIn this Victoria's Secret fantasy of hers she was/is dating Adam Levine and is a Victoria's Secret Angel. As a direct result of her pipe dream relationship with Adam, she banned me from being a fan of Adam and said that I could like James Valentine, the guitarist from the same band. She also \"claimed\" Sherlock from BBC Sherlock and several other guys that she considered hot. \\n\\nBasically, the rest of the group of friends and I were getting tired of her shit. We all were starting to realize what a bitch she was being a lot of the time and some of us (me being the strongest advocate) wanted to just cut ties. I was definitely the person that was closest to her, so they all pretty much accepted that I knew her best. But none of us wanted to have to confront her.\\n\\nWhat ended up happening is that she realized that I was mad at her because I had been talking to her much less. Her first instinct was to get closer with the others, but because of the horror stories I told them they didn't want to be the next person she took out her insecurities on. She then started ignoring us back. The whole while this was going on we all still hanging out like normal in school, though not outside of school.\\n\\nAfter about a week of ignoring us she just stopped sitting with us. We were all grateful and went back to normal really quickly, even laughing at how the only people that came to her birthday party other than her family was her dad's employee's daughter.\\n\\nMeanwhile, she was asking mutual friends what she had done wrong and why we'd been mad at her in the first place. She genuinely had no idea what she had done wrong. I still feel really bad about what I did to her, even though she quickly found another group of friends for hanging out with during school and she still had her internet friends. \\n\n",

apologize for the shitty writing, I'm exhausted right now and typed this *very* quickly.**\\n\\nI've had a less-than-friendly rivalry with a man we'll called \"Moriarty\" (we've recently signed an unofficial truce, but tensions continue). One day at my work, I was talking with my friends and Moriarty when he casually, with a smug smile, mentions that most of his flashbacks come from PTSD. Staring him down, I reply, \"From what?\"\\n\\n\"Huh?\"\\n\\n\"Why do you have PTSD?\"\\n\\nSuddenly, one of my friends chime in and says, \"You're really going to ask someone with PTSD how they got it?\"\\n\\n\"I don't believe him. I want proof.\"\\n\\nAnd with that comment, the entire room turned against me.\\n\\n\\nHere's the thing: I work closely with this man and he has shown *no* symptoms. He's a known liar (once claimed to have an IQ of 200) and I wouldn't put it above him to say this for sympathy. Now, of course, I could be wrong and I could just be an asshole. Which is why I ask you people, was I in wrong?\n",

Am I the asshole or were they?\\n\\nOk, so, I've lived with the same five people for three years now. In the second year, I and one of the guys I was living with got together. Let's call him John. So me and John got together in the second year of us all being together, that was all great.\\n\\nCome September, all five of us move out of that house and into another. However, this house has slightly smaller bedrooms, and out of five, only two have double beds.\\n\\nThis is where I begin to wonder who is being the asshole. One of our housemates took one of the three single rooms, fair play. But the other two, (both single, don't ever bring anyone back on a night out, basically only ever sleep alone in their beds) decide they want the double rooms.\\n\\nThis pissed me off a bit because, if I was living with a couple and there were limited single beds, it wouldn't even be a question for me- one of them should have a double bed. Because they naturally will share a bed every night. What couple wants to go to seperate single beds every night?\\n\\nSo long story short-ish, we ended up drawing names out of a hat, and lo and behold, the two single people get the double bedrooms. I hoped someone would be big enough to offer me or John one, but no.\\n\\nSo me and John now share one tiny bedroom which we ended up putting two mattresses on the floor and sleeping on that.\\n\\nSo, sorry it's so long but... Am I the asshole for thinking myself or John should have gotten a double bedroom, or are they for being selfish?\\n\\n**tldr: housemates took the only two double bedrooms in the house even though they're single leaving me and my boyfriend to have two tiny single bedrooms.**\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nedit: Just to clarify, when I say double bedorom I mean a bedroom with a double bed in it. Not like, a bunk room or something.\n",

                                             The driver stopped, rolled down her window and apologized, saying \"I'm so sorry. I didn't even see you.\" I responded by pointing out that the reason she hadn't seen us was because she didn't look.  I was calm, didn't yell or anything. My wife asserts that I was being an asshole for telling the driver she didn't look. Is she right?\n",

Meg has a physical disability and I think that she might have some learning disabilities and lacks social skills.  Over the last couple of years she has latched herself onto me and I have to constantly listen to all of her problems no matter how big or small they are.  \\nOur conversations are very one-sided with her just running her mouth constantly about how she hates her job, coworkers, family, and the list goes on.  Whenever I try to chime in  with my problems she turns the conversation back to herself, I can tell she's at least trying to be empathetic but it doesn't really work. Here is an example: I had a blood vessel rupture in my retina and she tells me that sometimes the scab on her leg bleeds(yeah, because that's fucking similar!!!!!). She knows what a retina is by the way, she just has to constantly talk about herself.I dont know if she's nacrissist or just super lonely.\\n\\nI feel bad that shes lonely but at the same time, i REALLY dont want to be her friend. Im so tired of her and when i know that i will be working with her for the day i always feel like shit. I'm usually a laid back and somewhat happy person but when I talk to Meg I feel stressed out and drained afterwords from just listening to her and my guilt of wanting her get the fuck away from me.\\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to befriend a miserable lonely coworker??What about the fact that she has a really bad handicap??\\n\n",

when he started he said theyve extended the budget to help him out abit, so he hired a load more people, i was concerned about my hours going down but he reassured me that hours wouldn't change, fine. a few weeks later and ive had 2 shifts over the past fortnight (before him i was averaging about 4-5 shifts a week), pissed off i decided to do some digging and ask two new employees what days they are working one has 3 shifts, the other has 2, i have 1, again. the guy with 3 shifts is a complete kiss ass and hasn't let go of my bosses duck since he started. now, we have a system where we post our availability for the week online, this week i was the first to post asking for as many days as possible, yet i get the least, i have worked here for about 6 months now and never missed a shift. so i confront my boss and after an exchange of long messages he starts to tell me how this other guy is 'hands down the best worker he's seen' and a load of other shit, which doesn't bother me, whatever. it's the fact that he told me that hours wouldn't change (which he denys btw) and that i post availability before anyone else yet get the least shifts. i think im gunna quit... AITA? \n",

I just heard this community exists and I thought it would be the perfect place to talk about this. I posted the whole story in /r/pettyrevenge and got a really mixed bag of responses, so I'm curious what people here think.\\n\\nBasically, I was at a John Mayer concert, in a pretty good seat but off to the side (not in the pit, which is relevant). When JM came out, he was playing a really rockin' tune, so I stood up and started jamming out. I would say ~90% of the people in the arena were standing for this, but my section was a disproportionately sitting one. I was really the only one in the immediate area standing. I would stand and sit intermittently as the songs went on based on the dance-factor of the song and how much I liked it.\\n\\nAt one point while I was standing up, two women about four rows behind me started throwing popcorn at me and yelling at me to sit down. I got really embarrassed and sat, but after a few minutes I was upset with how they had handled it, so a few songs later, I stood back up (with the help of my girlfriend and a few other people around us who had scene the exchange). By this point a few other isolated people/couples had done the same for a couple songs at a time. My \"petty revenge\" was subtly encouraging people around me to stand up, helping create a majority so that a.) it would be fine for me to stand and b.) the women would have a harder time telling 20 people to sit down.\\n\\nTo be fair, I was a lot meaner in the telling in /r/pettyrevenge, so [here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y9dny/standing_up_for_my_right_to_stand_up/) if you'd like to read it and the ensuing comments. I just kind of assumed people would be on my side, as you can tell by my whiny edit at the top. \\n\\nAm I the asshole? I want to believe I'm not, mostly because I think throwing popcorn at someone is incredibly rude, at which point I didn't care, and I would have responded much more sympathetically to a more gentle approach. Other people felt that I was not entitled to any courtesies because I started the asshole train by standing in the first place, and honestly I understand that too, which is why I sat down in the first place. I didn't want to be rude and block views. But I also believed that I wasn't in the wrong to stand given the nature of the act--he's got some jams and is very encouraging of light dancing. Still, for people that just wanted to sit down and enjoy the show, I was definitely hurting the experience. Please let me know what you think.\\n\\n**tl;dr** Stood up at a concert, got popcorn'd, stood back up later, encouraging others to do the same.\n",

                                            Just for a bit of context, this guy and I hang out literally 2-4 times a week usually. I started to hang out with a pal from school (We're not seeing each other in that way, she's a friend) and neither of them have ever talked to each other. So I made plans with the 'New Friend' and maybe twice I blew off my 'old friend'. I didn't do it on purpose, we hang out that often that I rarely keep track and thought nothing of it. One day when me and her were hanging out, the old friend texts asking if he can come over. I eventually said no, saying it would be awkward as neither of them knew each other or had any common interests.\\n\\nHe was also a bit sore because he was trying to get me into the Metal Gear Solid franchise when it really didn't do anything for me. He took it quite personally, and now with the whole 'blowing him off' thing he thinks I am ashamed to hang out with him.\\n\\nHe hasn't messaged back, so who's the asshole?\n",

I obviously could care less.  Granted I was a little mad but only because he told me she was flying in 5 minutes before he got her and we have an exam to study for. We study for everything together and he didn't trust me to tell me earlier.  \\n\\nSo the problem now.  I went to his place after she left and saw a weird design in the zen garden.  I mentioned I thought it was weird and raked it.  He noticed hours later and accused me of going behind his back and raking it.  Said I was jealous because some girl did it. I was unaware who drew the design. I had no clue it was her.  I don't know who she is. \\n\\nHe's says I'm the asshole for doing it and has been pissed at me.  Aren't zen gardens for raking? \\n\\ntl;dr Raked friends zen garden that his friend made a design in and he's mad at me. \n",

So on Saturday night, place is really busy, I have a million things to do, just the usual.  Co-worker sits a table of four and spends about ten minutes standing there talking to them. Door hosts usually just give them menus, tell them info about the place and hand them off to me. He finally stops chatting and waves me over and says they want to order. \\n\\nFor the rest of the time they are there he is CONSTANTLY coming over to them, for a good 10 minutes at a time, leaving the other door host, who has worked there for 2 days, by herself on the door.  They want to order more drinks and instead of telling me, which is standard procedure, he goes off to the bar and gets them himself.  I ended up having to ask them what they had so I can add it to the bill which I find really unprofessional.\\n\\nThey ask for the bill, I drop it and go to the back to get a drink for someone, and I come back to find him taking the payment.  Now door hosts are not floor or till trained, they are in no way allowed to use the micros, put in orders or take payments.  However I'm not going to go charging up in front of guests and grab the card machine from him so I let it happen.  I then find out at the end of the night he was boasting to other members of staff that my table gave him a £10 tip and he's keeping it.\\n\\nSo I put in a complaint to management, the next day they have an investigation meeting, I was on the floor at the time and during the course of the meeting he is crying and getting really upset.  And now I feel bad.  AITA?\\n\\nTL:DR Untrained door host steals my table and my tip, is generally unprofessional, I get angry and complain. He cries. \n",

AITA for not wanting to leave my hometown, or for pushing my partner to leave? Apologies for wall of text.   \\n  \\n**is ~~NAME OF CITY~~ ever on the cards? Even for just a year or two? I can take a thing down there to get my year 12 cert, and study something and get some qualifications up. then we can move anywhere, and we'd know we're strong enough as a couple to do it.**  \\n*No I'm not moving there, I hate ~~NAME OF CITY~~. I even hate staying at my pops*  \\n**we stay here the rest of our lives and work minimum wage jobs, because we'll never be able to afford to move anywhere nicer,\\nthat's the option we're picking**  \\n*What about you study in ~~NAME OF CITY~~ and I'll stay here, that way you can study and I don't have to move there*  \\n **this town is going to die. its already happening. its too small, and too focused on one source of income. once the smelters goes, and it will happen, theres nothing left here but a ghost town. Do you really think we can manage long distance? I'm the one who'll be studying and working, and travelling constantly to see you that's going to cause friction**  \\n*Well I'll come down and visit, I don't mind that but I'm not living there*  \\n**What about when I talk about hanging out with guys you don't know, going out drinking with them, or studying with them. You trust me, but feelings are irrational. you might not be jealous thinking I'll cheat, but I'd sure as hell be jealous that other girls get to see you more often than I do**  \\n*~~NAME~~ I trust you I know you're not like that and yeah only at work I don't go out a lot*  \\n**I trust you as well. But I don't trust myself not to get upset that I wouldn't be able to see you. and we'd grow apart. we wouldn't want to, but if I'm studying in a different place, I'm going to change. its how people work**  \\n*Its a sacrifice we have to take to make us both happy*  \\n**you mean your sacrifice is I leave and try and make something for us, alone and without your support, and you have to stay in the town you've known your whole life, surrounded by our friends, and change nothing. thats not a sacrifice. thats not a compromise. and then when I'm done with it all, I come back here to the town you've chosen to live in, and if everything went according to plan, we move to another town you've chosen**  \\n*So you can make something of yourself ~~NAME~~ that's the point of this so you're not stuck being a manager at maccas. That's what you want*  \\n**You'll see me more if you live with me than if we didn't. Im not saying this as a this year thing, we'd have another year to think about it, if I can get work here, which Im sure I can. But im not forcing you into it, but isn't it better you live in a place you don't want to for a few years, to ensure you get to spend the rest of your life in a place you really do want to?**   \\n \\n*I really do not want to move here*  \\n  \\n**I kno.... but I really dont want to spend the rest of my life here, and I really do want to make you happy by moving somewhere great for both of us. thats why they're called compromises. because they're not exactly what either side wants, but they're better than either extreme**  \\n*Well of course I have to move to a place I hate*  \\n**Im already in a place I hate, but Id stay here for you. You don't really have many dreams or goals that you share with me.... can you forgive me for wanting to do everything possible to make one happen?**  \\n*Idk really I don't want to move to ~~NAME OF CITY~~ but I don't want to be the reason you didn't study to be something. I'd feel shit with either decision  I make*  \\n  \\n**but at the end of one of the decisions, we end up somewhere you'd love. at the end of the other, were still here, still broke, still struggling**  \\n  \\n*Fine when do we move then*\n",

I made the best of it, and made some friends, one of which happened to be vegetarian. He never pushed his views on anyone and was a very funny and friendly person. He was a cool dude. \\n\\nAt any rate, one day in one of the camp \"classes\" we were using iPads to talk about dinosaurs. The lesson ended short, so the instructor gave us permission to look up videos on YouTube for the remainder of class (only a couple of minutes). We were partners, and just kind of looked at each other with no idea what to watch. I asked him if he wanted to watch something, and he said he didn't care, and I didn't know what to bring up on such short notice, but then something came to me.\\n\\nPrevious to my attendance at the camp, a friend showed me [this odd video](http://youtu.be/NyieI2bxyIk) about spiral cutting hot dogs. Forgetting this kid was vegetarian, I brought it up and had him watch it, eager to see his reaction. He was rather indifferent, and it was only later I remembered he was a vegetarian.\\n\\nWhen I realized that, it was already too late to apologize to him as camp was over, but I still felt kind of bad about it for some reason, despite him never mentioning the incident. Was using the little time we had to watch that video an asshole move? Just curious to see what you guys think.\n",

broke up. Then they moved into together. \\n\\nShe's happy, and she's really nice. She was the one I was friends with first.\\nHe wants a deep meaningful conversation and cries about her with me every time he goes drinking, and since they broke up, he's pulled me out drinking three times a week every week.\\n\\nAm I the asshole if I tell him I don't want to drink with him anymore?\n",

We talk everyday and hang out a on average 2-3 times a week. We started hugging more often, then cuddling during movies/t.v at my place and one night after one too many beers we start making out and have sex twice that night, he ends up sleeping in my bed and the next morning I discuss it with him. \\n\\nWe both decided it would be best if it didn't happen again, that neither of us regret the action and that we shouldn't tell his boyfriend about it. That we should try to go back to how things were. That works for a little while until one evening we end up sleeping together again. This time we talk a little more in depth about it, I tell him I like him a lot and he tells me that he thinks I'm cute and funny but that he's confused about his feelings toward me and that he's not the best at figuring his feelings out. He did say he knows that he's not ready to give up on his relationship yet and that it wouldn't be fair to me or him if I waited around for him. \\n\\nDespite being hurt by his words, he was very gentle about it and stressed that he would hate it if this ruined our friendship.\\n\\nSo now we're back to being friends, we still talk pretty frequently and hang out every week. Basically, everything is nearly identical to how things were prior to having sex. The only issue is that I still have these feelings and I'm trying to get over them. I don't want to change anything between us because I think that would hurt too much. \\n\\n**tl;dr My personal life has become a Taylor Swift song and it sucks**\\n\\n*Side Note: He confided in me after a month of being friends about his relationship problems and I learned that the boyfriend has a history of mental ailments (the BF claims to have Dissociative Identity Disorder) and neglected him for 7 months and cheated on him (my friend saw messages from other guys that are very incriminating). Point is, there's clearly a lot of latent animosity and it's all become unhealthy but he's trying to still \"make it work.\"*\\n\n",

                                               And I fucking hate his guts. He is such a piece of crap. My ex had a crush on him and I had to deal with it, but he knew we were together. A lot of people think he is attractive and my current gf just posted on his wall that she \"missed him and to come back into his life\". I know that's just how she talks and she doesn't mean anything by it, but it fucking hurts. She does not know the story, but I might tell her...\\n\\nI am not a controlling person nor would I ever attempt to limit her in any way. But she needs to understand how that status made me feel given the context; I hardly see her (once a week alone time for the past 2 weeks), she don't show me a lot of affection in public (hugs, sometimes kisses but not like I expect), so I am generally frustrated. How do she think her seeing this kid, given our history, makes me feel?\\n\\nSo would I be an asshole for telling her about him and me and being upset at her comment?\\n\n",

Deets:\\n\\nShe and I have been dating for a little over 8 months now. We are of completely opposite personalities, yet we have the most beautiful connection; something that I've never felt before. Recently we had to get rid of some lawn furniture that we didn't need and after a Craig'sList post her ex-boyfriend responded and accepted the furniture. Mind you, we are very open and honest with each other in our relationship, but recent conversations have me miffed --&gt; She wants to invite her ex-boyfriend over for dinner because she \"misses the friendship\" that they had. I'm pretty sure they had a lunch date together today, without her telling me about it. \\n\\nAm I The Asshole for confronting her about my intuition and gut feelings, or am I the asshole for her going on a platonic \"lunch date\" with her ex-boyfriend?\\n\n",

Then I made a comment about how me and my friend, E, have been best friends since 4th grade. She calls me out, and starts asking questions like \"what is hid favorite ___\" and it actually made me really uncomfortable that I didn't know most of this. I've been friends with him for years but we would always talk about other subjects and never got to know the favorites of each other.\\n\\nBut I digress, let's move on to when it gets worse...\\n\\nHe comes out with fireworks that detonate when you throw them. My truck was parked right next to where we all were. Its been in perfect condition for the past 8 years, and she thought it would be funny to start throwing the fireworks at [my truck (costs 40k, 2005 GMC SLT)](http://i.imgur.com/vCcIWV5.jpg). I told her to stop, and she kept going. I told her that I like to take care of my shit and don't want someone to come along and fuck up what I worked on for 8 years. She laughs and throws more. Then she takes the wrapper and stuffs it in a hole in the trunk for towing straps.\\n\\nWe all agreed to go out to a place. Everyone piles in another guys car, but when my friends gets in my car his GF jumps in and almost scuffs up my leather seats. Then she proceeds to take the lighter and \"playfully\" hit me along the drive. This is when I yelled at her. \"I've already fucking told you, Im trying to keep this vehicle in a good condition and everything you're doing is ruining 8 years of fucking work. Respect my shit or get the fuck out!\" He (he's a joker) sarcastically said \"hey man, apologize to her for that\" and he and I laughed nervously, then she started hitting me and said, yeah, apologize!\" Fortunately, we just pulled into the parking lot, and as soon as they got out my truck, I drove out of the parking lot, frustrated.\\n\\nI got home about an hour ago and still thinking about this. There's scuff marks all over the passenger side of my vehicle now, and I feel like a butthurt kid for getting so angry about it, but I try to take care of my shit. I'm not sure if my friend is seriously pissed at me for this.\\n\\n\\nEdit: turns out he wasn't being sarcastic. He thinks I should seriously apologize for slapping his GF on the hand when she kept hitting me.\n",

I have friends who're also on twitter and follow the same people as I do. Next saturday there would be a twitter meetup, in a student village and the plan was to go out. I planned to go with that (girl) friend of mine and asked to borrow the car from my parents since I didn't feel like hanging out all night with these people. (They have met lots of time and 80% of their friends are actually from twitter).\\n\\nThe monday of that week, I went to TED and thanks to Foursquare I discovered that there were some 'tweeps' over there there too, I talked to them for 5 minutes and he told me to come to the meeting.\\n\\nLater that week, another girl (let's call her Crazy Bitch or CB) had some free tickets to the avant-première of Thor 2 in a movieplex nearby, I replied and went over there to meet her and watch the movie. It was fun and asked if she came to the meetup aswell. She did and I told her she could come along with us since I have 4 places in the car and appearantly we live nearby. We ran into each other at school, even tough I had never seen her there before.\\nFriday evening was halloween night, so I was still tired saturday.\\n\\nThat saturday it was the infamous meetup. A mutual friend of me and my friend wanted to go out, since we were going to that meeting we told him he could join us, even tough he's not active on Twitter. CP let us know she and a friend were coming over soon, what? a friend? who invited her? You can't assume I have enough place to accomodate everyone. Because of that our mutual friend couldn't join, but that was no big deal.\\nI had to be home at 2 AM and felt like it would be late enough already around these people. So we're drinking and talking at different bars. Around quarter over 1 I tell CB that we're about to leave since we have to get the car and it's still a half hour drive. She tells us she's going to greet everyone. After 30 minutes waiting outside and talking to others, we get in to look for her. She was still talking and didn't feel pressured at all. We told everyone goodbye within 2 minutes and left.\\n\\nWhile walking to the car, CB's friend really had to pee. Are you fucking kidding me? We've been at bars ALL NIGHT! She's theatening to wet the car if she can't find a toilet. OMG, I'm mad and get the car meanwhile, while complaining to my friend. We leave the village at 2 AM.\\n\\nAs I'm on the highway and realize it's still 20 minutes till my friends home I ask them if it's fine to drop them there aswell, they can now call a taxi if they like. Withing the captial regeon, Taxi's are quite cheap. But the capital is also concidered dangerous, especially if you live in another city.. Which is totally exaggerated, especailly at 3 AM at the first exit of the highway. As we arrive the taxi's already waiting, and called to ask where they are. The friend asks if I needed money for the petrol. My parents pay it, so I don't mind, but since I was outraged I asked €10. All good I think and drive home, 10 minutes later I get in bed, 1 hour later than expected. (Besides, €10 is the student wage for one hour work, which is a perfect compensation. Also, the car is around €50k, devided by 200k km, multiplied by the traveled distance is also €10, so it's still justifiable)\\n\\nSo the next day there was a huge discussion on Twitter, I didn't notice until someone asked me about it in a Direct Message. I had no idea what this was all about and decided to ask CB, to my astonishment she blocked me. What? Well appearantly I dropped 2 young girls in the middle of the capital, a VERY dangerous city and they were unsafe. I am amazed, most people don't care or don't see what this was all about, some girls think I'm the devil, but I don't mind.\n",

But there's this part of me that's perhaps irrationally pissed off at my boyfriend for this reason. \\n\\nI'm a 21 year old female and I'd been out with my boyfriend and a couple of his mates. We'd been at a bar and I have an 8am shift in the morning so I had to go to bed. My boyfriend however wanted to go pick up some booze and go to his mates for some more drinks - absolutely fine by me. \\n\\nSo I call a taxi to take me home and he asks me if I want him to stay with me. I say no its absolutely fine go get booze with your mates. He offered a  couple of times and I said I'm absolutely fine just go. So he did. \\n\\nThen as I was stood alone in the street waiting for my taxi I realised I actually thought it was really shitty of him to leave me like that. And I know, I fucking SAID it was fine. I did. And that's why I think I'm the asshole. But.... A part of me just got annoyed he would actually leave me like that alone at night on the street. \\n\\nSo yeah I know I said it was fine, and this is the thing - I meant it at the time. I really did. I'm not one of those girls who plays mind games with guys (or at least I didn't think I was) and so when I said it it wasn't meant as some sort of fucking test.. I did mean it. But upon thinking about it I just feel like he should know it's not cool to leave a girl on her own at night like that? \\n\\nI text him about it but I feel like a dick. Does anyone want to confirm that for me?\\n\\n\\n\\n\n",

A few days ago I got invited to the most popular kid(Phillip) in the grades house to play FIFA. No big deal. (Keep in mind I'm about middle class on the social totem pole) I have a clingy friend (Shane) that's relatively low on the social scale, but I still try to hang out with him. I skype him from time to time and while skyping, he asked me what I've done for spring break so far. I told him I went to Phillips house and Shane flips 2 1/2 shits. He freaks out and gets mad that I didn't bring him along. I said that he should chill and that I just didn't think of it. He said he's afraid that I'm leaving him, which honestly might be true. I don't want to completely leave him behind, but if it comes down to it I know I will. I told him that he needs to chill in social situations and try to curb the random shit he says or I won't be able to hang out with him anymore. (Shane has ADHD and doesn't stop saying random shit) Even still, I'm not sure if he's gonna be a casualty of me moving up. Am I the asshole for not hanging out with him as much, and not inviting him?\n",

Its purpose is to make dirty or contaminated water drinkable. The filter I bought was from a very well respected manufacturer (Katadyn if anyone is interested) but this specific model had some major design flaws. I sent in my filter because it had failed after a short time and got a brand new unit in return. Because I didn't really trust this filter anymore, I got one from a different brand and sold the exchanged one on a small trekking forum. That was years ago and I kind of forgot all about it. Until I stumbled upon a travel report where someone has trouble with his water filter and eventually he and his friend become sick and have to cancel their trip. He wrote that he bought the filter on the forums, so I checked and it was in fact the filter that I had sold to him...\\n\\nSo now I feel like an asshole because I knew the filter was shit and I still sold it. On the other hand, it was a brand new unit from a respected manufacturer that is still sold at most commercial outdoor stores.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?\n",

I had a tiny budget, so I was getting around by hitch hiking and sleeping in my tent most nights. One afternoon I was picked up by a friendly older Kiwi. It turned out his business is consulting for struggling hostels, so he very frequently meets travelers like me and picks up hitch hikers. He has traveled the country dozens of times. On the way to my destination he went out of his way to take me to some cool thermal pools and pretty sights. It was great, because I likely would have just passed straight by them if anybody else had picked me up. \\n\\nHe was going on a speaking tour over the next week. Shortly before arriving at my destination he said, \"It's too bad your not going to this other way with me next instead. I could show you this spot and that. And I could get you free accomodation in these towns.\" Since he had been so friendly, and because I wanted to be open to fun new experiences and people, I decided spur of the moment to change my plan and keep traveling with him instead. \\n\\nI stay in his hotel room with him that night. He got us both dinner with the food budget he had from his employer. He then suggested we buy some alcohol, and asks if I don't mind paying since he got dinner. I had planned on giving up drinking at this point in my trip to save money, but I was happy to since he was being so nice and helpful to me. I bought a couple bottles of wine that got polished off pretty fast. And he ended up sharing a lot of whiskey that he had brought, so he was definitely giving back more than he was asking. We probably stayed up till 2 in the morning drinking, and had some great conversation.\\n\\nThe next day we move on to the next city, and basically repeat the night before. I buy a couple bottles of wine, and he very insistently makes me take a couple whiskey shots. At this point his personality is really starting to grate on me, but I figure it would be rude to leave early when he is expecting me to keep traveling with him for a couple more days.\\n\\nDay 3, while we're driving he straight up calls me out for not being appreciative enough of him. In particular, he said that I should be making more of an effort to buy food or drinks. He was mad at me that he had to ask me to buy the wine, and that I wasn't pushing to do so myself. His reasoning is that I should be spending whatever money I am saving by not staying in a hostel on things that we can enjoy. He frequently hosts couch surfers, and says that is standard practice when somebody provides you with a place to stay. But I actually spent more money traveling with him than I would have without. And it seemed unfair to expect we should each contribute equally, because I had almost no money and he had kept bragging about how much money he was making from each of his speaking engagements. This pretty much spelled the end of traveling together for me, and I hitched another ride while he was in one of his speaking engagements. He never responded to my message when I told him what I was doing. \\n\\nEver since I've been worrying about this general situation. I'm very stingy with what I allow myself to buy. So I'm also not usually buying stuff that I share with other people. But when other people offer to share with me, I will often take it. I think I'm kind of a free loader. Where's the line where being frugal for myself becomes obnoxious to those around me?\n",
       "75   So this happened on reddit itself, and I'm not sure of the policy of posting reddit links, but I'll take a shot at it anyway. \\n\\nBasically what happened was that the commenters were discussing this occurrence, and somewhere below I saw a comment which said, \\n&gt;I know that ultimately, the poor kid shouldn't be bullied over his backpack, but you ever see that episode of King of the Hill where Hank refuses to let Bobby become a husky boy model and pulls him out of a fashion show at the mall just in time to avoid having a nearby group of teenagers pelt the models with donuts? Then Bobby has a revelation and realizes how spot on Hank is and thanks him?\\nI feel like that's what's missing here- a Dad who just puts his foot down and tells him \"No, I'm sorry, but you're not taking that to school. You can hate me now, but trust me, you'll thank me for this later.\"\\n\\nI personally disagreed with some aspects of the comment, so I thought to write a reply with my opinion on it. Granted, at this point, I had no negativity toward the commenter at all, and in fact was looking for a conversation:\\n&gt;That's a backward logic that should have no place in school. A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants; if you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such. Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.\\n\\nLooking back, I can see how it may have came across as rude or \"attacky\". In any case, he responded back:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;That's a backward logic that should have no place in school.\\n\\n&gt;When have public schools ever anything operate on anything but backwards logic?\\n\\n&gt;&gt;A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants\\n\\n&gt;Yes, the my little pony backpack is total analogous to women not being allowed to wear pants.*Totally.*\\n\\n&gt;&gt;f you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? \\n\\n&gt;You should probably tell me I'd tell blacks to get to the back of the bus too, drama queen.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such.\\n\\n&gt;Letting your son wear a My Little Pony backpack to school? Yes, I totally agree.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.\\n\\n&gt;Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine.\\n\\nI realized at this point that I may have come across as overbearing, so replied trying to clear it up: \\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;That's a backward logic that should have no place in school.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;When have public schools ever anything operate on anything but backwards logic?\\n\\n&gt;Many times? Institutions which were influenced by feminist and womens rights groups dared to incorporate into their policy that women should be allowed to wear typically male clothing. \\n\\n&gt;&gt;A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, the my little pony backpack is total analogous to women not being allowed to wear pants.*Totally.*\\n\\n&gt;The logic used in both scenarios is most definitely comparable. I am by no means trying to compare the severity of both situations. \\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;&gt;f you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? \\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;You should probably tell me I'd tell blacks to get to the back of the bus too, drama queen.\\n\\n&gt;..Woah there, did I hit a bone with you? Never did I accuse you personally of anything, and if you read that as so, I am telling you now that I wrote that comment without any emotion directed toward you. If you have a problem with my comment, direct it to my words and not me personally. If you wish to continue to make this personal, then I have no interest in this conversation. \\n\\n&gt;&gt;It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Letting your son wear a My Little Pony backpack to school? Yes, I totally agree.\\n\\n&gt;In many schools, no bullying would result from this. Sometimes wearing \"goth\" clothing and makeup can get both girls and boys bullied in school, but that shouldn't force a parent to absolutely prohibit their children from wearing a certain kind of look. \\n\\n&gt;&gt;Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine.\\n\\n&gt;As I said, there are places where no bullying would occur as a result of this. In any case, even if you do desire to put slight blame and criticism onto the mother, that is an entirely different subject. The school as a governmental entity should direct the punishing to the perpetrators. If a girl wearing a miniskirt is raped by a classmate, the classmate should be punished and not the girl. As I said, I am not comparing the severity of these situations, but the reality is that the logic used to arrive to both conclusions is similar, and both are examples of victim-blaming. We don't live in a society where people are punished for increasing their chances of being a victim, and a school which runs because of the government should follow similar principles of righteousness. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis whole exchange went on and on until it became more personal. At this point, I don't want to bring more of a quote mountain than I already have, so [here] (www.np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/20odnl/tw_not_tumblr_9_year_old_is_banned_from_wearing_a/cg61ebk) is a permalink to the rest of the conversation. This is the point he begun calling me a piece of shit and to fuck off, and I was a bit shaken. I likely commented back too harshly as well. \\n\\nWhat do you think? AITA? \\n\\n^^btw ^^sorry ^^for ^^the ^^wall ^^of ^^text!\n",

I was just leaving my apartment to go to the grocery store, and I get to a \"T\" in the road. The other car, a pretty new-looking silver Audi, is driving down the straight part. I'll admit I wasn't 100% attentive at this moment, but I also think the Audi was going a bit too fast for being in a parking lot. There was no stop sign where I was, it was a situation where I was supposed to yield. I judged that the car was far enough away that I had time to make the turn, so I did. The Audi got really close to my car while I turned and had to stop. I knew I fucked up--I was pretty embarrassed so I didn't look to see the driver's face, but I could tell out of the corner of my eye that he wasn't happy. I thought \"Oh well, at least it's over. What's the worst that could happen, he follows me?\" (Which I never thought would actually happen. When this happened, he was driving in the opposite direction from where I was headed. This means he actually made an effort to stop and turn around.)\\n\\nFast forward about five minutes. I parked at the grocery store. I was grabbing my stuff to get out of the car, and I heard a knock on the window. I was about to get out anyway, so I opened the door. It was someone I didn't recognize. He starts to say, \"Next time, learn how to drive!\"\\n\\nI immediately realized who it was, and I said, \"You followed me here...?!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, you almost did some serious damage to my car. I live at--I actually work at [apartment complex], and I just don't wanna see people around there driving like that.\"\\n\\n\"I'm really sorry...what do you want me to say? Nothing happened. I'll admit I wasn't paying full attention. I'm really sorry. I don't know what else to say.\"\\n\\nAt this point, I was really freaked out. I figured if this guy followed me, he was at least a little crazy...but after that he pretty much accepted my apology and went on his way. I feel like I should mention that while he got out of his car to talk to me, he left his car parked in the middle of the parking lot. The incident had me pretty shook up for the rest of the day. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and it's people like this who are the reason why I don't like to leave my apartment often. I told my roomies about it later, and we wondered, how far would he have followed me? What if I was driving to the other side of town? This happened a couple days ago, and I've been terrified of running into him again ever since. \\n\\nIn my opinion, if you're so worried about your fancy car being damaged, don't bring it to a college neighborhood full of inexperienced drivers.\\n\n",

They left an envelope saying \"To my daring (daughters name).\" It contained a $100 bill. We believed it was for us to split for taking care of their dogs and house while they were out. When we returned to our house I swapped out bills because she owed me some money for gas (don't mind spending money on her, just when money gets tight I sometimes need it back), while she was in the shower. I told her when she got out that I had done so and she seemed a little upset. Later she tells her parents that she gave me some for helping. When I went over to their house to see them after they got back the first thing her step-dad does is dive into the same talks about our finances, like he always does, literally every time we are there he asks about my finances. I got fed up and left because I don't give a shit what her step-dad thinks about what I do with my money. Anyway I'm driving home when my gf calls crying. I tell her to calm down because I don't want her to get in a wreck. We get home and talk about what her parents said. Basically they said I control her and that I'm manipulative. Her step-dad called me a \"pussy\" because I walked out and that I'm never allowed back over to their house. Turns out she told her mom I took the money out of her purse. She did explain that I was getting paid back but it was no use. I realized now why they were so upset, she told her mom the night it happened and I didn't know that until about 3 or 4 days after the whole incident at their house. When she talked to her mom about the whole thing her mom will get over it but her step-dad basically said he doesn't want me over here etc. All I want out of the situation is an apology for all the name calling and being talked down to. So reddit AITA?\n",

I've known her for roughly nine months, and we became pretty close. Just within the last week or so, her hold on my psyche has been broken, and I'm speaking more freely around her now that I'm not quite so worried about what she thinks about me. It seems like all she talks about is her exes (plural) lately. It makes me extremely uncomfortable, but up until now I didn't want to say anything.\\n\\nThe other day we're having coffee, and it's a friendly conversation, but she starts spiraling around the same topic (her difficulties telling whether she's attracted to men as opposed to women). I tell her that she's really driving this topic into the ground, and that she's been saying the same thing over and over for ten minutes. She says that she doesn't act like an asshole when I do it (I didn't realize that I did, and I'm not sure if I do). I immediately apologize for my insensitive comment. We sit in silence for a moment, and she leaves as I sit in stunned silence asking myself what had just happened. It turned a complete 180 from friendly to hostile in a split second.\\n\\nI realize that this was probably something important to her to talk about, but I don't think I realized the degree to which it was. I definitely could have said something in a more delicate way or just suffered through the awkwardness inside myself (which I have done on more occasions than I can count for her), but I don't think that her tantrum was an appropriate response either.\n",

                                                   Tonight I went to Cold Stone to get a smoothie. I had $6 on me, which I knew would cover me since a smoothie is $5.59 plus tax ($5.92 total). I order my smoothie and go to the register, where the cashier tries to charge me $6.56 ($6.19 plus tax). \\n\\nThe $5.59 plus tax price is posted on their wall, and the higher price is nowhere to be found in the store. I ask why I'm being charged so much, and they say that the price is now higher. I ask them to show me where this higher price is, and the cashier goes to the back. She comes back and says she'll give me a discount, which comes to $6.03. I hold out my $6 and tell her it's the best I can do, which is apparently good enough. I walk out with my smoothie.\\n\\nAm I the asshole? This higher price may have been their legitimate price, but is it reasonable to refuse to pay it if it isn't posted anywhere in the store and a lower price is posted prominently on the menu board?\n",

Bonnie and I have been, as the story starts out, romantically involved for less than 5 months.\\n\\nI have the ability and tools to do certain jobs that Annie and Bonnie need done. Annie wants to compensate me (which I tried to dissuade her from doing, but she insisted) but Annie doesn't have the cash she thinks the work is worth. Instead, at Bonnie’s suggestion, Annie offers to trade a vehicle worth roughly what the jobs are worth. This vehicle used to belong to her deceased son (Bonnie’s brother). It had also at that time sat idle for nearly 4 years. Because I like the vehicle and have the ability to bring it back to operating order, plus want to keep Annie happy, I accept the offer.\\n\\nAfterward, Annie tells me that she preferred that the vehicle not go to Bonnie after I suggested that she drive it when she wanted (Annie said she was concerned about safety, as it’s a bit top-heavy, not a hardtop, and has nothing but a basic seatbelt). I then find that Bonnie has been really wanting the vehicle anyway, even though she knew of her mother’s objections. At this point I begin to suspect that Bonnie’s running a scheme to get the vehicle despite her mother’s wishes, but since it’s just a suspicion and otherwise we’re having a great relationship, I let it go.\\n\\nI complete just about everything that Bonnie needed, plus some other things that come up incidentally. In the meantime, I’ve spent a good bit of money and time getting the vehicle back into operating order and making a few improvements. The jobs I need to do for Annie require that one or both of them be present or allow me access to out-of-town property. I complete a couple of days’ worth and then something weird happens. Every opportunity that I have to work for Annie, Bonnie has convinced her to take a daytrip, or some other distraction, or gives me conflicting information regarding the arrangements that keeps me from being able to complete the work. Bonnie goes quiet when I ask about this phenomenon, and our relationship falters.\\n\\nDespite what I feel are one-sided efforts on my part to discuss these and other issues, our relationship starts to cool at the 10-11 month mark. I make the split, finally and at the time amicably, after 14 months, with Bonnie bemoaning our “lack of communication” and telling me that only she knows what her mother REALLY wants/needs, and states that my understanding of Annie’s clear language is severely flawed. Due to this and other factors, some of the jobs that Annie needed done did not get done. I don’t feel comfortable contacting Annie directly and risking coming between her and her daughter (they’re basically the only family each of them have left in the local area).\\n\\nA couple of months after we split, Bonnie contacts me on Facebook, requesting that I give the vehicle to her. Due to the abusive nature of her language I do not reply, but instead block her on Facebook and from calling or texting me. I have not blocked any communication from Annie, however, but have yet to hear anything at all from her. If they can maintain a good relationship by both hating me, I’m OK with that, even though I still regard Annie very highly.\\n\\nI do not live/work/travel through the areas they are in, so it’s not likely that they will see the vehicle. Besides, I have altered it’s appearance in various ways, and I don’t feel that they would immediately recognize it if they did happen to see it. Just to throw one more factor in, it currently needs a major repair to the transmission that, according to mechanics much better than I, is likely due to the long time sitting idle.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\n**TL/DR; I've got my ex-GF's dead brother's car that her mother gave to me, and the ex wants me to give it to her.**\n",

Even when I did, I was rarely given praise for it, other than a short 'well done' or 'good'. Basically I was expected to be a 'good little girl' and just do what I was told. \\n  \\n  Then there's my cousin. He basically never tried at school and left at 16 with close to nothing to show for it. He was also, and still is to some extent, allowed to do as he pleased. He just seemed content to sit on his bum, collect his unemployment money and just generally laze his life away. Any attempt to speak with him about going to college and getting some qualifications (I wasn't the one speaking to him to clarify.) or about applying for work was met with 'dunno' or 'I'm looking at a course' or 'I'm speaking to a mate' or some other lazy excuse. \\n  \\n  So skip forward to two weeks ago and a family member mentions that she's heard from someone she knows that there is this job going which my cousin should be 'perfect' to do. Stuff happens, calls get made and abraadabra, my cousin gets the job, no effort required on his part.\\n\\n  Now part of the problem I have with the whole thing is that the same help wasn't exactly forthcoming when it came to my own jobsearching, and if anything I was made to feel quite a shitty, horrible failure of a human being by my family for it. There were times when things devolved into screaming matches (not instigated by myself for the most part) because of it. \\n\\n Rather it was the situation that it was down to my effort, despite my family, to find jobs, to post CVs to companies, to secure interviews and then to finally secure the job I now have. All of it was because I put in real effort and actually did something. \\n\\n  Another part of me also feels resentment because I know that my cousin isn't the person my family thinks he is. They think he's this wonderful innocent kid, and that he's somehow on a pedestal because he'll do a few odd jobs for them now and again. Yet I've seen the other side of him for myself and I know he's just playing the goodie two-shoes act so he'll get the praise (and money/favours) from them. \\n\\n So, am I being an asshole or not here?\n",

       Here's the OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/21alb5/guy_didnt_get_his_car_key_because_he_was_rude_to/\\n\\nI thought the guy in question was definitely rude, but that OP's response was a little overboard, as well. Car keys are pretty important; if I were working at guest services and I was pretty sure we had the guy's key, it goes beyond petty revenge to answer him in a way that implies I don't.\\n\\nDoesn't look like many people agreed with me, as I'm currently sitting at -12 - [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/21alb5/guy_didnt_get_his_car_key_because_he_was_rude_to/cgbhv6g?context=3) - and the first comment reply calling me an asshole is at +10.\\n\\nI just thought this situation was a little weird because I've never even made a comment in the negatives before, and I really don't see how I'm wrong. Obviously the guy who lost his key was really rude and shouldn't have acted that way, but OP is in the wrong, too.\\n\\nSo yeah, AITA?\n",

We were friends on Facebook. After graduating, she deleted her account. I deleted my account a few months later due to some unrelated issues, and then made a new one a few months later. I learned that nobody had heard from Megan in six months. As of a month ago, nobody had heard from her in almost two and a half years. I decided to Google her and found a Photobucket with some pictures of Megan in underwear and some of her in a see-through top. (No bra)\\n\\nNow, I have admittedly masturbated to Megan multiple times in high-school, so I was super excited but worried that Megan had put her full name on. I saved all the pictures, made an account, and commented on one of her pictures:\\n\\n\"Hey Megan, this is polarbear2217 from *name of high school*. How are you doing?\"\\n\\nI was so excited that I shared the pictures with my friend on Facebook, and then regretted it after my hormones cooled down. \\n \\nShe locked the album two days later. I feel better that nobody can find it, especially since the idiot put her FULL NAME on it, but I feel guilty for several reasons.\\n\\n1. Googling her name. I honestly just wanted to see if her name was mentioned with regards to some college or if she had a blog. I did not expect to find her in her bra and panties.\\n\\n2. I couldn't figure out a way to private message on Photobucket, but commenting one of the pictures in a blasé manner doesn't seem like the best strategy.\\n\\n3. I still have the photos downloaded and sometimes I still masturbate to them. I can't believe my luck that I found them (she was one of the top 3 girls in my class I wanted to see naked), but I feel like an asshole for looking at them since she closed her account when she learned that I had found it.\\n\\n4. Most importantly, sharing them with my friend in the heat of the moment. As far as I know, he hasn't told anyone,  but I feel extremely guilty.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\n\\nP. S.

Calling around, tailoring my CV endless times etc. All whilst trying to maintain an income and have a decent social life. I help for free with the family business - a manager position - when I manage to spare some time. Also have a GF who I try to see at least twice a week. Volunteer at various organisations to gain experience relevant to my degree (Law) and am going abroad on related business next week.\\n\\nI always do little bits here and there for them. I streamline various bits here and there; find the cheapest suppliers for the business, maintain the website, set up their emails, write letters, make executive decisions when called upon, give advice...In return I live rent free.  \\n\\nI was in the kitchen cooking when stepdad comes in and asks if I'm busy. Now I know what is coming so I say \"Yes I'm busy\" thinking it obviously depends on what hes going to ask me to do and I'd rather find out first. So a few minutes later I say \"it depends on what you want me to do\" which is met with no reply. Hes thrown a hissy fit. For a huge ex-special forces guy he is a fucking massive drama queen. \\n\\nMum says I shouldve asked what it was he wanted me to do *first*.\\n\\nMy argument is that he shouldve just said that he wanted me to do a small task for him and then to outline what it was going to be (buy something on ebay) - I can easily do this - I couldve done this in the time its taken me to write this post.  But instead he asked whether I was busy which in my opinion is very ambiguous. \\n\\nThey maintain that I'm the asshole and that I should 'get off my high-horse' even though I'm pretty sure I did nothing wrong. \\n\\nThe thing is, I've started treating him as he treats me. Going back to the family business: we urgently needed a custom refrigerator designed and built. He is a handy man - proficient at most trades. When I overrode his design decisions as to the design, he threw a hissy fit again and said that I could do it my way but expect no help from him. SO I made the decisions with the fridge guy and when I looked to stepdad for approval he basically just puts his hands up and says 'Ive got nothing to do with this'. I think thats petty. \\n\\n\n",

To make a long story short, when his pass gets rejected from the scanner on the second day, it turned out that the mountain only gave him a one day pass while I got the two day that we both thought we had.  He had the receipt and they did only charge him for the one day lift ticket, so I'm assuming the ticket people just misheard him or hit the wrong button or something.  Obviously this would be a total pain in the ass for anyone, but you would have sworn it was the worst thing that had happened to him in the past year.  He threw a goddamn fit in the lift line.  Me, being a little bitch for some reason (probably too nervous about confronting a friend, especially with a 4-5 hour drive in front of us), didn't really say anything.  I kind of passively agreed with everything he was going on about as if I was only half paying attention.  I somehow got dragged in to his plan to go confront the service desk.  He did all the talking while I just kind of sheepishly sat there and presented my own lift ticket when he asked.  They didn't reimburse him.  Instead, he would have had to buy a second one day pass which would have been about $20 more total than just getting the two day pass in the first place.  In a final act of angry principal he refused to buy the ticket and starts heading to the car to leave.  I guess he expected me to go with him but seeing as how I paid full price and wanted to ride the entire second day (this was at like 10:30), I told him that I was going to stay and ride.  He ended up staying in his car (he drove us) for a few hours while I stayed on the mountain.  I did come back earlier than I would have otherwise, but I'm sure it was still boring as fuck for him.  One thing I will say though, is that he had really been being a jerk for the entire trip.  He had bitched about everything from how far the restaurant was from where we were staying, to the people we shared the lift with to how much this mountain sucked compared to the ones he normally goes to.  If he hadn't had been such a dick for the past two days I would have been willing to compromise or help him out in some way, but at this point I wasn't feeling too generous towards him.\\n\\nThe ride back was pretty awkward.\\n\\n\\n\\nWas I the asshole?\n",

All four of us go to the same university. We all know each other since high school and apart from this particular problem, everything is fine.\\nI try to keep myself in line, go to class, work out every day, eat well, and so on. I know and admit I am boring.\\n\\nProblem is, I get up mildly early, 6:00-6:30 am everyday. I normally have early classes and when I don't, it's off to the gym before class. They usually don't have anything before 10 am so every night, they stay up late and loud. Playing videogames and typically yelling* up to midnight/1am.\\n\\nI ask them every other day to keep it down and their excuse being that I go to sleep too early, I should expect noise.\\nI don't want to play it passive-agressively so I try to keep my volume down when I get up and make myself breakfast.\\n\\nI'm starting to think they are right and I'm overreacting. I am pretty jealous they get to have a full 8-9 hours of sleep when I can't because I'm trying to keep myself in line.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?\\n\\n*Yelling might not be the right verb to use, English might also not be my first language.\\n\\nEdit: Formatting\\nAnd I might also add that I always go out and ask them to keep it down as politely as I can but the day after I have to do it again.\n",

I'm Indian and used a combination of Mediahint and a VPN every 15 days to refresh the \"vacation\" time for Spotify. According to Spotify, I'm in the US, and the ads are American too. What gets me though is that none of the products that are advertised on Spotify even come close to bearing relevance for me. ProFlowers advertises a bouquet for an \"offer\" amount of my parents' weekly grocery budget.\\n\\nI could go on listing the ads from McDonald's products that will never be available here to \"superior\" motor oil by some startup introduced by a gruff announcer who sounds like he gargles gears for a living, but accusations of being a shill are never more than the mention of a successful product away. \\n\\nOne moment I'm listening to Let it Go for the hundredth time, and when it's done, I listen to one of these ads that is my \"tax\" of sorts for all this legally free music. But it's useless. I'm ripping off talented artists whose income comes majorly from these ads that I couldn't possibly get anywhere by clicking from Madurai. The only price I'm paying is time.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\n",

Two weeks ago, I come home and three young males, high school age, come out of the gate on the fence between my home and that house. As they walk away I shout at them that I'm calling the cops if I see them again doing that. They get into a new Camaro that's parked at the end of the street and drive off. I didn't get the plate number. I figure they're in there smoking shit or something. Didn't look thugish. I call security. Just to let them know what happened. They show up with the cops in tow. They go into the house, find all the sliding doors and windows open and close them.\\n\\nThis afternoon I see an SUV parked at the same spot. I get suspicious. I peek over the fence and yep, there's a window and a sliding door open. Security says call the cops this time. I come out to wait for the cops and there's the black Camaro with 2 young males in it, just idling by the curb one house down from the vacant one. They drive off. 3 cruisers show up. I explain it's not THAT big a deal, I just want a report filed. Report gets written up. I get a copy.\\n\\nAITA for making a fuzz about some kids going into the house next door to smoke some weed? They didn't look like thugs. Just some kids from the neighborhood. Cops said it reeked the last time when they went in. Just some kids hiding out to smoke some shit.\\n\\nBut. This is Miami. We live next to the wall inside a gated community and there's nothing on the other side of the wall but empty lot. We got broken into two years ago. A dude was murdered walking to work one morning less than a mile from our backyard. A couple was killed for their car a half mile down the street from that. You get the picture.\\n\\nThe guy across has seen them numerous times going in there and never called security or the cops. This is what's making me doubt myself. Maybe he sees them, figures it pretty harmless and doesn't bother. Cops show up on these kids and they could get arrested, screw up their lives, and for what? for hiding out to smoke some dope?\\n\\nBut the house is not theirs. It's vacant. It's private property. Now the windows are open. Anyone can go in there. I'm looking at the window every little knock I hear now.\\n\\nI actually *want* to be the overreacting asshole because that would mean I don't have anything to be so worried about.\n",

happens every time I mention smoking.  Maybe Reddit is secretly super anti-tobacco and I just never noticed?  [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/21ou6v/its_time_for_me_to_take_controlnow_where_the_hell/cgfc40j ) is the conversation in question.  I came to /r/personalfinance looking for help.  Don't get me wrong, I got it--but in the thread I'm sharing here, I got repeatedly prodded for my lifestyle choices as well.\\n\\nI'll admit, I list it a little at the end there.  I felt it was justified, but the karma counter seems to disagree.  Am I the asshole here?\n",

The divorce has been very \"messy\" with my parents constantly putting me and my 17 year old brother in the middle. Both my brother and I live with my mom and see my dad a few times a week. \\n\\nBoth my mom and I work at a hardware store together. My dad came in yesterday, like he usually does every now and then, looking at some clearance items in flooring and decided he wanted to buy some plus order some more. I told him I'd handle it all and call him later. I was told to put his items aside in the back and called him when I left work to let him know. He said he and his girlfriend would come in later that night to make sure she liked everything my dad was planning to purchase. \\n\\nMy mom was working at that time so I texted her letting her know they were coming to give her a heads up. Later my mom freaked out saying I shouldn't have brought him to the store, although he came by himself, and I shouldn't help him because of the way he treats her and she let everyone at work know that I don't live with him so if I let him use my discount I would be fired. She also threatened to not come home that night, but she eventually did really late.\\n\\nWe've been going back and forth all day. She thinks I should have told my dad not to bring his girlfriend in. My dad isn't a reasonable person so I don't think he'd listen, and I really dont see how I'm supposed to control what he does. I'm also upset that she blames this whole thing on me when it seems like it's a problem between them. I'm also not happy about her airing out our dirty laundry for all our employees to see and also threatening my job.\\n\\nI'm sorry this is so long but if anyone has actually read all of this and would like to offer an opinion it'd be greatly appreciated. \n",

If he is truly evil wouldn't he reward the evil-doers that end up in hell?\"\\n\\nI thought that one of the commentators was being a little rude, and I called them out on it. In hindsight I could have been a little nicer, and I want to make sure I'm not the asshole here.

For this the band shell out a fair sum of money. \\n\\n  Now a few months ago, this friend of mine mentioned to me that they were recording again and asked me if I were interested in recording the bass if they needed someone. I said that it sounded a great idea and so we left it at that. At this stage he did mention to me that he'd cover the studio fee for me and that he'd pay me whatever my rate was for the work. \\n \\n  Two weeks ago, he emailed me telling me that he'd written this song, which needed a bassist because it was a slap-bass line and he wanted a real bass sound and not a computer playing it. I agreed to do a rough draft recording for him for nothing, as he's a good friend and I thought that with even a really rough recording he would at least be able to get a demo version done and find someone to play it in the studio for the proper version. So I recorded it for him on my own time, sent it to him and thought nothing more about it. \\n\\n Last week he contacted me to tell me they were hitting the studio with the song and asked me if I was interested in doing the session with them playing bass again, this time for real. We discussed the details and I could make the studio date and time and so on. Then I asked him about the money we'd talked about before, and this is when things took a turn. He told me that he'd agreed to pay my studio fee, but that he was hoping that I'd do it for them pretty much 'as a friend' (his words, not mine, meaning he wanted a freebie) because I'd done the draft recording for nothing. I told him that if he wasn't willing to pay me as promised, then not only was I not doing the studio session, but that I wasn't willing to let him use my draft recording either. \\n\\nAITA?\n",

I've worked at the same company for over 5 years as the database reporting guru. Six months ago, we hired on half a dozen new guys to build out Business Intelligence processes. They have not grown on me. I perceive them to be cliquish and always having meetings where nothing gets accomplished. I am more about production and building solid relationships with the business units.\\n\\nThe topic at hand is a payroll report that I have spent the past five years on, changing it as the business needs it. I have resisted delegating it to my own team because it's such a business-critical thing. Over the past week, the new guys started working on a payroll report. Their manager (who is mine, too) said they were doing it for a different group that I'm not involved in. Until last night, when he tells me they have finished the payroll report that will replace mine, with very little collaboration from me.\\n\\nI want to swear at him, tell him to go to hell, and complain about going behind my back. I've looked at their code, and it's missing a lot of important pieces that are in mine. As a bonus, they discovered a way around a broken data source that will let me improve mine. \\n\\nIt infuriates me. I don't want to come across as a diva and say it has to be done my way or no way, but I really think this was the wrong approach on their part. I *AM* the expert on what Payroll wants, so if they wanted to help, it should have been more collaborative. I feel that I left myself open for questions and discussions. \\n\\nI haven't responded to the email request to look it over and give my critique because I'm afraid I'm going to get emotional and act like a bitch. AITA for getting upset? Do you folks have any advice for this difficult conversation I'll be having?\n",

We kept talking and she suggested we skip coffee and just go back to her place and have sex. Like any man, I was perfectly okay with this.\\n\\nAnywho, after we \"bumped uglies\", we started talking about what we want to make out of this. I said I'm up for anything, but I'd rather be in a relationship as opposed to just being FWB (it was a weak moment and obviously I wasn't in complete focus after fucking her five minutes before). She seemed insulted by my wishy-washy answer, but I just ignored it and moved along.\\n\\nSo after I kiss her goodbye and all that, I'm heading home and I realize I just spent at least five bucks in gas, and took about 3 and a half hours out of my day seeing this girl. I came to the conclusion during the long drive home (45mins) that there's no way I can keep a serious relationship going when I have to take a whole day to go see her (btw, I'm the only one who drives, and I don't have a ton of extra money for gas, or a girlfriend right now).\\n\\nI told her how I felt about this a couple hours ago and she just went crazy hostile towards me, telling me how I \"used her to get what I want and now that I'm done I'll just ignore her forever and hope she goes away\". I tried to have an adult discussion with her and instead she decided to attack me, making me all in all pretty shitty about myself.\\n\\nMy question to you reddit: Am I the asshole for changing my mind about this?\\n\\nEdit: She just told me to \"fuck off\", so I guess that's that.\n",

After college, I wanted to live on the west coast, she wanted to live on the east coast - it didn't work out and we broke up after about four years.  We're still good friends, and talk from time to time over the two years since we broke up.\\n\\nMy new girlfiend of six months doesn't like that we've remained in contact with each other.  She feels threatened and she thinks of this communication as cheating our relationship.  She wants me to stop talking with my ex and has said that we (my new gf and I) will have to break up if I don't.  \\n\\nTo me, it seems like an unfair demand.  I wouldn't tolerate it regarding family, I wouldn't tolerate it regarding other close friends.  I love my new girlfriend, but I don't think she should be allowed to force decisions like this in our relationship.  \\n\\nAITA?  \n",

name, lets say BlackX and BlackY. When on the server BlackY left, So I meant to ask but I messed up and asked \"Why did BlackX leave\". I then responded with a quick joke \"Sorry all you blacks look alike\". After that about 4 other people on the owner and BlackX laughed but then another player thought I was a racist, and a player only on for a day if I was going to be like this he would leave. This is when the owner changed his tone. After seeing that the owner changed his position so did BlackX and they felt like I needed to be tempbanned so I don't deter future new players.\n",

It was around 2am and I had been studying, and was about to go to sleep. When I said no she got perplexed, and demanded a reason. I just kind of shrugged it off and went to bed, but this morning I woke up to a couple texts and a snapchat saying I was an asshole. Am I? \n",

I pointed out the rule of /r/transformers as you can see. He typed out that 1/2 paragraph response of insults. He went through my post history and actually downvoted a lot of my stuff (didn't make a difference in karma) and he had been calling me childish? He did not get the age right either.\\n\\nBackstory is that he often makes posts in the subreddit showing off how he bought multiples of a sought after figure. There really is no other purpose for it. He also showed that he will give away gifts ( [this] )(http://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2221tx/one_bought_two_gifts_from_gf_and_transfan_friend/) from his girlfriend and a friend that was a fan. \\n\\n_____\\nIn case anything ends up deleted\\n\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/M8lbzSB.png\\n\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3NBhNSm.png\\n\\nEDIT: https://i.imgur.com/m3V5x0X.png - this one has 2 of his comments deleted (the tagged downvotes are just for show, no real effect)\\n____\\nEDIT 2: https://i.imgur.com/0N4kBYJ.png - Now he's threatening me (although it's probably not true). I am most certainly reporting him.\\n\\nAlso edited because the man himself pointed out a mistake in what I wrote. Sorry, fixed that bit and wrote in that you're selling unopened gifts.\\n___\\nAnother edit. Seems like those screenshots are now handy considering he's deleted his comments.\n",

I'm a high school junior(17) and I have been hanging out with this girl I have an interest in. She however is only 14 so there is some age and maturity difference. So I have been hanging out with this girl exclusively with another guy who is a senior(18) I had asked her before we hung out the first time to go to a movie with me and about a month later to my birthday which was also a movie. She said yes to both of these and then about a day before said something like Oh sorry I have &lt;some excuse&gt; I'm so sorry I can't go. This annoyed, me after the second time I was thinking about confronting her but decided against it because if by some chance these were legitimate wouldn't want to be the fool who accused her. So more info about the senior we've been hanging out with, he is extremely obnoxious often flipping off other driver and yelling,\"FUCK YOU\" or telling her to \"SHUT THE FUCK UP &lt;name&gt;\" he also often breaks the law (i.e. stopping in the middle of the road reversing for about 50 feet, going 90mph). Even if this is meant to be satirical I don't find it funny and have had to deal with this in order to hang out with her. I texted her one day that I wanted to get lunch with her on&lt;day&gt; and what she thought, she responded no less than 5 mins later saying how much fun we'd have and how she'd love to go(some additional info: we had a school performance(8-10:30AM) that morning followed by the banquet that following afternoon(6-12PM)) I said I'd meet her or pick her up to go to the restaurant at 12. We get to that morning and we are talking about it and she still confirms that we are going to have so much fun and it's going to be great. So the performance ends and we both leave agreeing to go. \\n\\nI text her to be sure she's arriving at the restaurant at 12(it was 11:30) she says she feels bad for not inviting him(the senior) and says we should hang out another time. \\n\\nI told her if he was a good friend he'd understand. She then text something along these lines,\" &lt;My name&gt; it's &lt;his name&gt; I don't understand and don't think you two should go.\" \\n\\nI call up the senior and ask hims whats up he says he has no idea what I'm talking about and says he doesn't care if we go.\\n\\nI tell her this she says \"There are plenty of other times we could go with the senior.\"\\n\\nAt this point I was done with the bullshit.\\n \\nI told her that \"If you don't like me to just tell me to my face instead of pretending\"\\n\\nTo which she said,\"DON'T SAY THAT\" \\n\\nI reply with,\"Then stop acting like it. &lt;his name&gt; doesn't care you shouldn't feel bad.\"\\n\\nShe replies that \"it isn't a big deal\"\\n\\nTo which I say, \"It was to me I've had a really bad week(my phone was stolen the day before) and was really looking forward to this\"\\n\\nI then inform her of the other 2 times she has blown me off. I said I didn't care those times but this was the third time.\\n\\nAfter she tells me I'm overreacting I reply, \"You know what maybe I am, I'll make you a deal if you make plans with me for another date(as in time) and follow through I'll completely forgive you. Without &lt;senior&gt; or anyone else.\" \\n\\nShe has yet to reply and completely ignored me at the banquet. I feel really terrible even though I'm pretty sure I was absolutely justified to be upset. I've only got opinions from people I know so I feel they're a little biased. Also should I try to make up with the girl or just not try until she apologizes. Being on bad terms with her is probably a bad option because she will be in my group next year and senior would have graduated plus my best friend in the group is quitting and my 2nd best is graduating. \\n\\n**TL;DR Girl I like blows me off for 3rd time, I get upset and tell her off, she gets upset at me, I feel bad**\\n\\nUPDATE: First of all thanks for all the wonderful responses. Second I like to mention that I talked to her during school today told her I was in the wrong and apologized she then said that it was completely reasonable and she was sorry. I could tell she didn't mean that but I appreciated the attempt. I'm just going to stay friends with her and I'll just try my luck with some one else.\n",

I was expecting an offer to pay me more when I said I was thinking about quitting, but they said nothing of the sort. So I got another job and put my two weeks in.\\n\\nIts hard to leave, I've made great friends, but I'm so done with the place. I was hands down the best worker, and was even told so. I couldn't get off to see a dead relative last meeting, and I've always been the guy to get shit done. I'm like the knight, basically I do all the kings work but get shit out of it.\\n\\nI put in my two weeks on a Wednesday, the schedule covers Monday through Sunday. I said I'll do two weeks, meaning in two Wednesdays no longer will I work there. They scheduled me for Thursday, Saturday and Sunday after I was supposed to be done. I can't do Saturday or Sunday, but I don't think I should be obligated to do any of it.\\n\\nAITA for not showing up after my asshole of a manager relies on my generosity to show up?\\n\\nEdit: forgot to mention, the last Saturday I was supposed to work, I called out due to vomiting and diarrhea. I called ahead of time, so it wasn't really a problem.\n",

I know her to be a powerful and kickass woman and so I immediately assumed someone did or said some serious ugly racist bullshit to her because she is not the sort to have something like that generally effect her. \\n\\nI responded that I had no idea what it was like to be a POC but that her fear was legitimate, that she and her kid were two of the strongest people I know and that I will always support her. That was all that was said by me.\\n\\nA person whom I did not know, but my friend knows responded that my \"white lady entitled intentions and musings were completely full of shit\" How dare I even \"speak about legitimacy\" and how \"noble it was of me not to be a racist and did I want a fucking award for it?\" \\n\\nI did not respond but, she continued to assault me verbally in several more comments afterward, the gist being that I was a racist piece of shit. It really rattled me. Would it have been better to not say anything to my friend? Was it presumptuous of me to even respond? I just wanted my friend to feel like I had her back, was I being entitled by merely addressing the issue? I immediately thought after it happened that I didn't do anything wrong but, then I started to ruminate and now I honestly don't know.\n",

Toward the middle, I started not going on often, maybe once every week or so. \\n\\nI had always thought I knew of ways to improve the server and I mentioned these in the chat. This staff member would disagree and we would talk about it. I always thought these were friendly debates.\\n\\nFast forward to today, I made some comment about something and he asked me if I had a minute where he could talk to me. He told me I needed to stop complaining and that everyone was talking about how they didn't like me for complaining. This shocked me because I always thought these were group discussions and other community members thought the suggestions were good ideas. I also was shocked because I didn't think I did this often enough where the regular community would notice.\\n\\nI have most of the private messages in an album along with images for a later part of the story.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/a/YzK8E\\n\\nI told him how I was shocked by this and he told me how I should have posted these suggestions on the server forum. One message that was cut off said something like \"I'm not a big fan of the forums and that's just my problem.\"\\n\\nHe wrapped this conversation up and I went back to doing things. During this time, stuff started to sink in. I decided I would quit the server because I didn't feel welcome. I started selling most of my valuables and plots (since it was an economy server), I said my goodbyes, and left.\\n\\nAfter this, I went on the server forums and posted a list of my suggestions just like the staff guy said. After a minute or two, it was deleted. I went to the guy's profile and see that he was active so I thought maybe he deleted it and I went to ask him what was wrong with it.\\n\\nYou can see this part in the second half of the album.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/a/YzK8E\\n\\nI should mention that this was a high up administrator on the server and the server doesn't allow swearing because really young kids play on there sometimes.\\n\\nSo that's the situation, Reddit. Am I the asshole? I know complaining a bunch is really an asshole thing to do but I really didn't know I was offending anyone. \n",

She is extremely rational/logical and hates inefficiency and incompetence (INTJ, for those who know MBTI), while I'm more of a sensitive idealist who tries to avoid conflict (INFJ).\\n\\nThis has resulted in some clashes of values in the past, but in general we get along quite well.\\n\\n----\\nToday I had heard about enneagrams (a personality indicator) from another friend, and thought it was pretty cool so I shared it with her through a text, asking her what her results were on the test. She didn't reply, so I assumed she was busy and resumed studying for exams. \\n\\nA few hours later, she responds with \"Apparently I'm majoring in entrepreneurship\". I was pretty distracted from studying, not really remembering what we were talking about, and so I assumed she was talking about school and not enneagrams. \\n\\n*It's important to note that enneagram results are portrayed as numbers from 1 to 9, they don't have anything to do with majors, which is relevant for the next part.\\n\\nI was pretty confused because she's majoring in chemical engineering, not entrepreneurship, so I told her she should probably talk to her counselor and get it changed. \\n\\nShe responded with \"Sigh, never mind\" and I realized I was probably missing something important, so I asked her what I missed, and she told me \"Don't worry about it.\" \\n\\nAt this point I was pretty frustrated because I'm a curious person, so I told her that what she's doing is making me even more curious. I'm assuming that she was getting frustrated as well, because she responded with \"Good, go suffer\"\\n\\nAfter a few very confused minutes, I looked back and realized that she was probably talking about the results of her enneagram test, and I expressed this revelation by saying \"OH YOU TOOK THE TEST I GET IT, MAN I'M SLOW\". She responded \"Sigh. Sometimes I wonder about you\"\\n\\nNow I didn't think this was very nice, because given the context of being in college plus the fact that I was distracted made me think that she was, in fact, talking about college in her text, and so I explained this to her. \\n\\nShe replied with \"I don't know why I bother\"\\n\\nI didn't think her treatment of me throughout this entire exchange was fair at all (especially given the fact that she assumed/implied that I was stupid because at first I misunderstood her text, despite my explanation of the misunderstanding to her), so I told her \"You're judging others by their actions and judging yourself by your intentions\"\\n\\nShe then gave me the cold shoulder and said \"Have a good rest of the night\"\\n\\nSorry about the wall of text, but after reading all of that am I the asshole in this situation? I really don't know what I did wrong.\\n\\n----\\n**TL;DR:** Told a friend her behavior towards me was unfair by saying \"You're judging others by their actions and judging yourself by your intentions\" and she responds with \"Have a good rest of the night\" and proceeds to ignore me. Am I the asshole?\\n\\nEDIT: After talking it out with people similar to her on the /r/INTJ subreddit, I decided to just forgive and forget. We hung out today and everything's fine; neither one of us brought it up. Thanks for the help everyone!\n",

who asked me, a few days ago, to help roof his house. I agreed to help. So he calls and asks me to drive an hour to where he lives and start at 9am and work until 2pm. Now I already cleaned and put in a lot of work when he bought that house a few months ago. And cleaned out their family barn for his wedding last fall. For nothing in return. AITA for wanting to just say straight up no?\\n\\nEDIT: Or should i feel bad for wanting to negotiate? Thanks RoonilaWazlib\\n\\nUPDATE: I did it and it was fun and I was probably being kind of a dick for not wanting to. I got pizza and beer.\n",

My family and I don't get along, but we still value each other as human beings. I thought I set a clear enough context that you could tell I wasn't trying to tell everyone to hate their family, maybe I didn't?\\nLet me know, I didn't want to be a prick.\n",

I don't really mind, because mostly its been great deals.\\n\\nIn the discussion, one user posts about how this new bundle in the thread, Bundle Stars, is better than Humble Bundle and then proceeds to post a [photo](http://i.imgur.com/nAM5ED8.png) that implies Humble Bundle has become a greedy mobster cat (???) that only wants users money.\\n\\nSo I simply ask why it has to be a war when they both offer great deals. Then, for some reason, I argue with various users about why I think Humble Bundle is still a good place. I probably should have just let it go, but I really found it weird that people legitimately were HATING on Humble Bundle. I never thought it was a bad thing, I get some bundles from there and they usually have great value and I get to decide where the money goes (developers, charity, or humble bundle).\\n\\nWhat I didn't expect was to be downvoted so heavily (my top comment is now positive, but the rest are very negative and even that top comment is highly controversial in terms of up/down and it isn't Reddit's algorithm, as it was at -14 earlier).\\n\\nPeople have even begun to accuse me of being a Humble Bundle employee (I'm not). Am I an asshole for defending a service that I think is good?\\n\\nEDIT: I should probably mention that I legitimately wonder whether or not I should just let this sort of thing go in the future? I saw the other side as being childish, but perhaps I was also childish? Fanboyish? I don't know. It's the internet, this place is weird.\n",

                                               This is really stupid but we were at a crowded bar the other day and my gf was talking to her friend (Sorry to be so blunt but the best stereotype she fits into is \"Loud fat girl\") and my gf was telling her how I really liked the purse Loud girl gave her for her birthday and how I had suggested she wore it that day, since it was in fact her birthday. When loud girl heard this she got up and shouted at the top of her lungs \"OOHHHHHH NEW SOCKSSSS GIMME A HUGGGGGGG\" and I was super shocked and embarassed that she was being so fucking loud so I denied her hug. She just sat back down.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for being embarrassed that she was being super loud at a public place and out of embarrassment decided not to return her hug?\n",

We already had a history of not being super nice to each other, as I see her bossing my roommate around all the time (none of my business I know) but this day pushed her to almost full out hatred of me.  We had a table for over ten people and they are sitting across from me.  The meal goes fine until we get the bill.  The waitress hands out pens for the receipts since we all payed by card.  We all get similar pens except for her, she gets one of the nicest pens I have ever seen.  This thing had heft and mass, and wrote like a dream (I borrowed it after she used it to sign my receipt). It looked almost exactly like [this](http://static1.jetpens.com/images/a/000/006/6234.jpg).  As we are about to leave she starts talking to her sister about taking the pen.  I overhear this and mention that they shouldn't take the pen, they in no way need it and the waitress is just working to support herself.  I work part time at a restaurant and see first-hand how hard waitstaff works and see how in their stressful job how something small can push them emotionally.  My buddy's girl snaps at me right away saying, \"My mom would think it's just fine\" in the the absolute rudest way possible.  Not wanting to get into family business or anything I do not mention her comment, but do ask her to picture herself as the waitress paying for bills, school, etc with this job.  In the same tone as before she quick retorts, \"My dad would would take it too.\"  At this point, I'm ready to leave and I see her stashing it away in her purse and I casually mention to her that I think her and her parents are thieves and get up to leave.  She does not take kindly to this, and makes a fuss about needing to leave right away.  I am exiting the building and still see her still making a fuss about whatever she was talking about to everyone else.  When we got back to our place, I did apologize for saying what I did, but ever since then she never talks to me or says hi even though I see her almost daily.  Am I the asshole for this?\n",

I took an impromptu trip up to O, and took the last bit of my brother's weed (that he left in Orlando). Now I'm talking an amount not even measurable with the American dollar. Substantially less than a $5 nug, and I only got one hit out of it. I left $20 in its place with a note that said, \"Collateral\". \\n\\nFast forward 2 weeks later, he decides he's going to Orlando. I quickly tell him of what happened and offered to give him way more weed than I took to bring with him, plus the $20 cause I felt bad. He flipped his shit and made a scene and said he left it up there so he wouldn't have to drive with it. Very valid point, but I found out later he brought up weed anyway, but just denied my offers, and still took the $20. When he came back he was still mad and told all of our mutual friends and our parents. Said that the $20 didn't mean shit.\\n\\nThat's the story. First off let me say that I understand it was very wrong for me to take something that wasn't mine, which is why I apologized profusely and offered him reimbursement plus the $20. Still received a shit storm though. Why do you guys think? What if it happened to you? Am I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: let it be known that I have caught him stealing weed from me before (not red handed), got him to admit it, he reimbursed me with the amount of weed (no fucking $20), and we went on with our lives. Didn't lose my shit.\n",

Everybody but a couple living there was on the lease, and we didn't think this would be an issue as we had all been friends for 3 years we trusted everyone in the house, blah blah blah.  I should also note that had this couple not agreed to live with us we would not have rented the house due to the rent.  \\n    Cue the summer, we still have several months on the lease and everyone is graduating and moving on or looking for new jobs.  The couple decides that they dont want to live at our place anymore and sign a new lease for the summer without telling anyone.  They then tell us that they are going to move out and cant afford to pay rent at both places.  According to them this is ok though because they saved us money by agreeing to move into the house with us so rent would be split between more people.  I am not going to start a bunch of petty fights while we still have to live together because they are already locked into the new lease and we have no real legal recourse to make them pay rent so I remain civil until they move out, but everyone is pretty pissed off.  \\n    After they move out I stop answering their calls and texts because I no longer want to be friends with someone who pulls that move.  A week after they move out the female in the relationship is blowing up my phone and I ignore her calls.  She calls my roommate who is nicer than me and he answers and says he doesnt know why I would be ignoring her calls as that is between us two.  She texts me and asks why I am ignoring her.  Keep in mind I am almost positive that she is calling because she wants me to hook her up with one of my weed guys as I got a text from her boyfriend asking to buy an OUNCE the day before, but he couldnt afford the rent he skipped out on.  I told her unless she was calling to pay us the rent money she fucked us out of, she could fuck off.  She called me an asshole. AITA?\\n**TL;DR:Trusted friends, shouldnt have.**\n",

He told me he was on his way to pick up a little weed. I was dry, and he asked if I wanted some bud because he was getting an OZ, so of course I said sure. It wasn't gonna be much, just about a bowls worth because I didn't chip in. He was a little hesitant after he asked, and almost decided against it. \\n\\nThat's not the first time he's done that. He always invites me to smoke and when I get there, he shows me what he's got. After a few minutes of just shootin' the shit, he ends up deciding against smoking his stuff, and suggests we only use mine. When I confront him about this, he says stuff like, \"it's my weed, you didn't pay for it. If I wanna save it for myself, I can. I don't have to smoke with you at all, ya know.\"\\n\\nSo anyways, he agrees that I can get a pinch for myself tonight. He tells me that after he picks up, he's gonna stop at our friend Jackson's house and give him like 5 or so grams. Okay, no big deal, he'll stop by my house after and drop it off. \\n\\nAfter about 3 hours of waiting for what should have been him picking up weed 3 streets over, stopping by my buddies house, and then dropping by my house really quick (probably about 45mins with hanging out at Jackson's house for a bit included) I texted him asking him what's up. He tells me, \"oh my grandpa told me to come home for dinner.\" I ask him if he dropped the weed off at Jackson's, because my house is on the way from Jackson's to Billie's. Yup. He stopped by Jackson's. Then he came clean and just said, \"I forgot lol.\"  Nope. He stayed at Jackson's for an house and a half, getting stoned and drove home completely forgetting to stop by my place. \\n\\nI'm just annoyed at this whole situation. This type of thing happens a lot with a lot of other things not including weed. I never ask to keep any of his stuff, he is actually the one who asks to keep some of my weed for himself. I say yes sometimes depending on what I have. I don't let him walk all over me, I just feel like if I'm gonna be a bro to you, be a bro back. And if you're gonna drive by my house without a second glance, at least text me. And don't lie saying you had to go home for dinner. \\n\\nHe came back really hostile with \"it's my weed man, I don't have to give you any. I said I would because I was being nice. God forbid I forget about you this one time.\" But it isn't this one time, he always does this. Am I the asshole? I mean he's right, it is his weed. Help please:(\n",

quite a while, it's getting pretty serious, she went through my stuff in my drawer and found cards and random crap from my ex over 5 years ago from high school, I keep these because it was like high school memories, some stuff from friends in there too. Well she saw them and tore them all up into little pieces and stormed out. Texts me later saying fuck you and such, I say that what she did is really disrespectful those are my personal belongings and are so old and I don't care one bit for the ex in question. She thinks that I'm stupid for thinking she would be ok with me keeping that stuff. Very mad she is, threatening to never talk to me again, I simply said I don't want to hear from her unless she is apologizing because I think she crossed the line. Am I the asshole\n",

She comes from a rough background (both parents passed away). She was then taken in by a family friend (semi mother in law). We are moving away together. My parents have helped my girlfriend by letting her live rent free in my apartment to save up, etc. They will also give her a head start rent free when we move. Semi mother in law, whom Ive met twice and never given her a reason to distrust me, told her that I was probably only into the relationship for a green card and that my parents were only helping her for that reason. None of this is true. I love my girlfriend deeply and my parents are good, generous people who want to help her because I love her and because they know she's had it rough. Semi mother in law knows nothing about our relationship and she has been known to be a bit of a racist. I really wanna say something, albeit respectfully, about how I found it very offensive that she would make these assumptions knowing nothing about me, my parents or our relationship. My girlfriend got pissed at me for this. Am I the asshole for wanting to stop a racist?\n",

We named her after my great grandmother, which means a lot to our family.  It's a less common name, but not completely obscure. Part of the reason I picked it is because we don't know anyone else (living) with the name and wanted to avoid having 5 of the same name in her class. \\n\\nTwo of my friends from high school married each other. Just this weekend their baby is born- and they use the exact same name that we named our daughter.  I know both of them. They live around the corner from my parents, go to the same church as them,  and I'll probably see them at the same functions fairly often.  We have hundreds of mutual friends.  We interact online quite a bit. \\n\\nI'm pretty annoyed.  Maybe it shouldn't matter, but it feels like they stole our name. \\n\\nTL; DR Two friends used same name as my baby, 6 months later. I'm ticked off. \\n  AITA?"

I work more hours than everyone.  Show up first, leave late, etc.  The office has an air conditioning system which I turn on and set to 72º every morning.  We don't run it at night.  It's in New England and humid as fuck, so when you come in early, the place is dripping wet making it easy to feel uncomfortable at 70º when you always have to wear a coat and long pants.  But after an hour of dehumidifying, 72º is fine.  A co-worker of mine who only comes in once a week (and usually late) comes in dressed in designer clothes fit for going to the beach on a hot day and announces that it's too cold in here.  I can't wear less and be dressed appropriately, and management isn't going to take the risk of criticizing a woman's fashion choices.   I told her to wear a freaking sweater and left the AC on.  *Am I the Asshole?*\\n\\n**TL;DR: I adjust the AC to make it comfortable in work-appropriate clothes.  My co-worker wants the whole office hotter so she can dress like she's outside in the summer.**\n",

People keep asking me when it will be completed and why it's taking so long. I am merely a foreman(assistant) on this job. I am very fed up with these questions and not completing it as well. I have started to vary my answer to 3 months plus a year for other new construction but that doesn't concern the opening as much. Or my other answers are laugh it off or get pissed, but don't give a direct answer. Am I an asshole for being so bitter over this project? \\n\\nIt's hard writing unbiased. \n",

I've been trying for a while to eat healthily and lose weight. So have they, but yet every time they go to the store, they bring home junk food. \\n\\nI understand that it's hard for them, but it's also hard to stay on track with my healthier lifestyle when there's junk food all around me. Plus, they're getting older, so it is crucial for them to get healthy now.\\n\\n\\nA few weeks ago, they brought home 4 bags of donuts, and I emptied each pack into the trash.

I usually come home once every 2 months or so. I wouldn't play games at campus since I would be really busy so the only time I play games is when I get home. Normally, my parents hate seeing any sort of gadgets in our hands so me playing games in front of them is already a mistake. for context, we're staying temporarily in a 3 bedroom apartment since our house is being renovated so I had to share a room with my sister since the master bedroom is my parents' room and the 3rd room was the storage room. because of this, my study table is in the living room so there is where I play my games. yesterday, for the first time in so long I played games on my mom's laptop. you may ask why my mom's laptop well it's because both my parents each broke a laptop of mine. and that's because they hated that I played games. anyways, my mom wasn't home and I just started playing and I see a light flash behind me, I turn around to see my sister holding up her phone. I asked her what she did and she replied saying \"oh nothing I just took a picture to show mom that you're playing games on her laptop\". I didn't think much of it and only played for another 10 minutes. then, my mom comes home and starts shouting and screaming at me, calling me all kinds of names and wishing all kinds of things at me for playing video games. well at that moment words didn't come out of my mouth I just stood there dumbfounded then turned to my sister and saw her smirking. I just stayed silent, I mean there's nothing for me to say but after that I just didn't speak to neither of them.\n",

Max was 4 at the time of adoption, and the adoption agency let her know that he was timid and not good with children. He is about 40lbs, and looks to be a cattle dog mix. \\n\\nWhen I met Max, it was immediately clear that he would benefit greatly from training. This dog barked very loudly as soon as I walked in, cowers against my mom at all times, wanders listlessly and cries whenever she leaves, and whenever I walked out of my room would bark aggressively, and once rushed up to me barking and growling. I told her he needed training, but no, she says he would never bite. \\n\\nShortly after, he snapped at her friends young daughter when they met on a walk. I insisted he get training, but no, he is just a sweet baby and she doesn’t have children so there’s not an issue. \\n\\nNow we are all together for the holidays. My husband hugged me while my mother took our picture, and Max ran up to me and grabbed my pant leg and ripped it off from the knee down. Oh no, he thought I was being hurt and was protecting me! Literally 30 minutes later he snapped at my cousin as she walked past and caught her skirt. \\n\\nMy grandparents have called me anti dog, my mom has accused me of not liking max, and says things like “oh I’m sorry max, OP just doesn’t like you!” But like… I am not against dogs. I am a firm believer in dogs receiving training that they need! I’m so afraid that he will get the wrong person and they will press charges. I have this sick feeling that this will end badly, but everyone thinks I’m just being a jerk who doesn’t like my moms beloved dog. \\n\\nI admit, I’m more of a cat person, but I would be all for Max if he wasn’t unpredictable and if I thought my mom was doing the bare minimum. My whole family loves this dog. So Reddit..  aita?\\n\\nTLDR: my mom has an unpredictable dog with a bite history that I refuse to overlook. Everyone else loves him and thinks he’s a sweet baby that doesn’t need training. Aita?\n",

But my Mom wanted to hold a small party with some food and kareoke so she could invite my friends over, even though I said I didn't want anything like that, but due to her insistence I was forced to oblige. When the day came, I had just gotten home from a sleep over, I was tired due to playing games all night with my cousins, so when I got home, my family was already getting prepared for the party later afternoon, and of course I was told to help set up. After a while I went to my room for some much needed rest and I was planning on just being by myself until the time arrives for the party to start, but until then everything was peace and quiet, like I had originally intended. But everytime I was about to dose off, my mom would order me around, and if I didn't, she would guilt trip me about how much she didn't get much sleep or how much effort they were putting in, due to me not wanting to feel like an ungrateful ass, I reluctantly get up from my bed and do what she asks. And due to that, I feel like my day is legitimately ruined, I would put in the bare minimum of assistance and I would always have a frown on my face. I'm grateful for what they're trying to do for me, but I never asked for any of this, I just wanted to do the things that I wanna do for once... Am I the asshole?\n",
       "2171918    \\n\\nEdit: Boyfriend  insist I add that we've been together 8 years and that if this happened a month into our relationship, he agrees it would be psychotic, but what's a donut or two after 8 years. \\n\\nThis is so dumb but this is somehow one the bigger fights we've had. \\n\\nI bought a shitty donut earlier today after me and my boyfriend finished some Christmas shopping and had dinner. I bought one and we were gonna share it. We regularly share food.\\n\\nWe go to my parents house to pick up our dog and chill out a bit before going home. I'm in the bathroom, and my boyfriend starts eating my donut and telling me how bad it is, stale and there's no creme in it (it's a Boston creme). I tell him that there's no way he's eating my donut right now and to stop or at least save me some.\\n\\nHe eats the whole donut. \\n\\nI get out of the bathroom and I'm kinda upset I wanted some donut tonight, he's being silly and put himself in the ''corner'' in the kitchen pretending he's there out of shame. I'm upset and ask him if he really ate it and he makes a joke and says it was so bad and not worth the calories. \\n\\nI just wanted a donut so I tell him that and he should save me some. (He says he apologized here but I do not remember this.) We go back into the living room and my dad is telling me drop it and that I'm overreacting for no reason. My mom is telling my boyfriend to apologize just because it obviously bothered me and that reason enough to apologize. My mom was kind of condescing towards him and the vibe got tense. \\n\\nI don't want to start some dumb fight over nothing and so we say our goodbyes and leave. \\n\\nOn the way home I ask him to apologize and he says I'm making a big deal out of nothing and hugely overreacting. I say he's gaslitting me. Were both upset. \\n\\nWe get home and keep talking about it in circles. I just want an apology to end it and he starts yelling that I'm being a ''five year old\" and that I \"made a scene in front of your parents\" and that I'm \"overreacting so badly he doesn't recognize me\". I'm mad cause he's \"gaslighting me into thinking I'm wrong\" and \"yelling at me for no reason\" and \"it doesn't matter if the donut was bad or not at least half of it was mine\". Anyways he yells my feelings are hurt and we go to seperate rooms and chill out for a bit. \\n\\nLater we talk about it a bit and both apologize, but maintain that we are in the right. \\n\\nSo Reddit, who right in this extremely dumb fight?\\n\\nWe have both reviewed this post and agree with its facts. \\n\\nTLDR: \\nMe - mad he ate my donut because we were meant to share. Doesn't matter that it was a bad donut, it's the principle of the thing. \\n\\nHim - he claims he wouldn't have been mad if I ate 'the last oreo' as an example. And that I dragged it out for too long (meaning my anger cause it was just a donut.) He says that he felt singled out my by mom and that that's worst than the donut.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE : He bought me a box of 6 donuts the next day, my favorite ones. \\nAnd he apologized.\\nAll is good, but thanks Reddit!!\\n\n",

I explained that if it was nondenominational or Christian I would consider it but I don’t feel it’s fair to pressure me to compromise own morals when I wouldn’t expect the same of her.
