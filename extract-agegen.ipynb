I work more hours than everyone.  Show up first, leave late, etc.  The office has an air conditioning system which I turn on and set to 72ยบ every morning.  We don't run it at night.  It's in New England and humid as fuck, so when you come in early, the place is dripping wet making it easy to feel uncomfortable at 70ยบ when you always have to wear a coat and long pants.  But after an hour of dehumidifying, 72ยบ is fine.  A co-worker of mine who only comes in once a week (and usually late) comes in dressed in designer clothes fit for going to the beach on a hot day and announces that it's too cold in here.  I can't wear less and be dressed appropriately, and management isn't going to take the risk of criticizing a woman's fashion choices.   I told her to wear a freaking sweater and left the AC on.  *Am I the Asshole?*\\n\\n**TL;DR: I adjust the AC to make it comfortable in work-appropriate clothes.  My co-worker wants the whole office hotter so she can dress like she's outside in the summer.**\n",

People keep asking me when it will be completed and why it's taking so long. I am merely a foreman(assistant) on this job. I am very fed up with these questions and not completing it as well. I have started to vary my answer to 3 months plus a year for other new construction but that doesn't concern the opening as much. Or my other answers are laugh it off or get pissed, but don't give a direct answer. Am I an asshole for being so bitter over this project? \\n\\nIt's hard writing unbiased. \n",

At one point he was in the hospital for like a week and I offered to watch his elderly dog for him and walk her twice a day. The dog got sick in the apt so I had to go in and clean dog diarrhea off the carpet. Aside from the smell from the poo the odor was unbearable. I have a pretty strong stomach and I was crying and running outside every few seconds gagging badly and almost puking. It was really really bad. Smelled of old pee and poo and lots of it. So today he comes to our door and tells us he has to move and asks my husband if he could help move the heavy stuff and asked if me and my daughter could help pack boxes. Normally we would help in a heart beat. But after I found out what the inside of his apt is like we both gave excuses why we were unable to help. He ended up finding others to help and they did not look happy coming out with the first round of stuff. My husband has felt bad all day for not helping but we both feel that neither of us could have stomached it at all. But now I'm wondering if we ATAH for not helping. So AITA?\n",

       "2178382    AITA here?\\n\\nMy SO and I started a business and am doing decent, not well off, but we have turned a profit a lot quicker than I thought we would.\\n\\nI am literally doing 100% of the work. I have worked myself into exhaustion and sickness getting this off the ground. He is working a regular job to keep paying the bills.\\n\\nAnyways his mother and him have been no contact for a while and they just started talking again. She offered him a hefty loan to help \"his business\" I'm talking over $20,000. As long as I was \"just an employee\". She has ALWAYS hated me, but I won't get into that.\\n\\nWhile yes, he has gotten me a few orders from his coworkers, I am still creating and doing 100% of the job while also doing the social media part. He doesn't even know how to work the machine or the programs to run it. While it was his money that got everything in the beginning, I have earned that back twice over on my own. \\n\\nWhen I heard him say that I was just an employee so I said, \"As just an employee, I QUIT.\" I seriously stopped in the middle of a project (not an order but a prototype for a possible product) and went to our room. Heck I still have paint on my hands while typing this.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nUpdate: we won't be getting the loan. He called her and told her that I am the CO OWNER and that the business wouldn't even be close to where it is without me. In fact he couldn't have done it without me at all.\n",

Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\\n\\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\\n\\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore.

       "      <td>Backstory: I'm a semi-professional competitive gamer (on a throwaway, won't go into much more detail) who goes to events, and plays for money. I live at home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and younger sister.\\n\\nThe hours my team and I play are between 6pm and 12am every night, although not for 6 hours continuously; it may be 9pm till 12am, or 6pm till 10pm, etc. and obviously I'm talking during those hours. Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\\n\\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\\n\\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this, all because I game competitively and am trying to win money from winning events?</td>\n",

Here's some of the undesirable qualities about him.\\n\\n* Incredible snoring. I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven't approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was \"have you told him about your snoring??\" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It's too loud not to know. This is fine, you can't help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I'm not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point...\\n\\n* He's a lazy fuck. He's very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it's because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn't do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn't help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality..\\n* He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn't stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a \"stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3\". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn't even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it.\\n\\nTonight though, I thought about something. I am talking about him a lot. I mean, he gives me a lot to talk about. However, I feel like I may be just as bad as he is, talking about him and the things he does with my friends and floormates behind his back. So, am I the asshole? Am I the asshole for talking about him so much and making such a big deal out of him, or is he simply the asshole and I'm responding to that?\\n</td>\n",

After I met her, I told my son (let's call him Tyler) that I thought Katie* was really sweet and smart and looked like she liked to eat.  Ok, I know that sounds bad, but Tyler's previous gf Dakota was borderline and refused to eat in front of anyone, and it always bothered me. I mean, if Tyler invites you over for a holiday meal, at least sit at the table and play with your food.  I guarantee no one would notice, but they will notice you sitting on the couch sulking.\\n\\nBut I digress, and I had to, to make the rest make sense.  About a year later, Tyler and Katie were hanging out here and he tells her what I said.  She looked kind of upset, and I know she thought I was making a comment about her weight, but I swear I wasn't.  I explained the whole Dakota situation, which she should've understood because she knew her and hated her with a passion.  I apologized, and explained what I meant.  I thought we were good.\\n\\nCut to **three** months later.  I'm at work and get a text from Katie's mom:  \"You're a fucking bully!  How dare you talk to an 18-year-old child like that.  You told my daughter she was a fat pig!\"\\n\\nWhat?  She texts back:  \"You're a sad pathetic cunt picking on a child.\"  This goes on and on.  I mean, I thought we were friends.  This literally came out of fucking nowhere!\\n\\nI tried to explain that I love to cook, and I love when people come over and they like to eat.  I really don't give a shit that the girl weighed 200 pounds.  Whatever.  My son loved her, so I loved her.\\n\\nSo am I an asshole for saying a girl looks like she likes to eat?\\n\\nEdit:  I forgot to mention that later on Katie's mom said she'd call the cops because I was harassing her.  I was ignoring most of her texts but at that point I texted her my address and said please, call the police.  Needless to say, she didn't.</td>\n",

The divorce has been very \"messy\" with my parents constantly putting me and my 17 year old brother in the middle. Both my brother and I live with my mom and see my dad a few times a week. \\n\\nBoth my mom and I work at a hardware store together. My dad came in yesterday, like he usually does every now and then, looking at some clearance items in flooring and decided he wanted to buy some plus order some more. I told him I'd handle it all and call him later. I was told to put his items aside in the back and called him when I left work to let him know. He said he and his girlfriend would come in later that night to make sure she liked everything my dad was planning to purchase. \\n\\nMy mom was working at that time so I texted her letting her know they were coming to give her a heads up. Later my mom freaked out saying I shouldn't have brought him to the store, although he came by himself, and I shouldn't help him because of the way he treats her and she let everyone at work know that I don't live with him so if I let him use my discount I would be fired. She also threatened to not come home that night, but she eventually did really late.\\n\\nWe've been going back and forth all day. She thinks I should have told my dad not to bring his girlfriend in.

I have always known that this is not the career path that I wanted to take, but in fear of disappointing them, I never told them and ended up actually attending a semester at a very nice college with the hope that it would grow on me. It only made me even more sure of my decision to quit and go into a field that only requires specific training. My mom was understanding and more supportive than my dad, who has never been the same since. Everything up to this point only serves as contet for the actual altercation. \\n\\nI was 18 when this happened. I had been home for a couple of months and searching for a part-time job by my parents' demand. I was sending out dozens of applications, but my complete lack of prior experience was making it difficult to even get a call back. One day my dad gets home from buying pool chemicals and tells me that they had a help wanted sign on the door and for me to apply online for it immediately. I didn't have a problem with this, so I went to the website to check the listing. It was a 21+ management position. Later, he asked me if I applied, and I told him that I was underage and not qualified so I didn't bother. This made him very angry, telling me that I would do what he said and to send in the application anyway. I repeated that I was 18 and have never had a real job before, much less a management position. We argued back and forth with the same thing for a bit and it eventually came to him saying \"I'll just apply for you. Give me your resume and be quiet.\" I said \"I don't have one, so you'll be sending in nothing,\" to which he replied \"Don't be a smart ass.\"\\n\\nA little more context to go with the first bit: I had heard my father curse only once before this, and it was after a severe injury, so this marked a serious escalation in the seriousness of situation where my family is concerned. The tone he used in saying this was very agressive and threatening, so my 18 year old reaction was that I wasn't going to take verbal abuse from anyone, so I said \"Was the language supposed to drive the point across harder?\"\\n\\nAnd this broke him. He got up from his chair and started walking toward me saying \"How about I beat your ass right now?\" My adrenaline replied \"Do you want to try?\" At this point my mom ran in screaming at my dad to stop, and he backed away from me but continued to the heart of what he was going to say. As best I remember it, he said \"I'm sick of your fucking bull shit and I'm sick of you. I pay out the ass for your school your entire life and you thank me by dropping out of college after one semester and pursuing a white trash job. You're an ungrateful little shit and it makes me want to leave this house.\" And then he stormed off. \\n\\nNow to the present, I'm still at home finishing up mechanic's school, and our relationship is still very awkward. We rarely speak. My mom has always sided with me on this situation, reminding me that his mother was severely bipolar and his father killed himself, so he probably inherited a mental illness and to not take what he says too personally.\\n\\nThe way I see it is that there were many times in the fight where either of us could have ended it more peacefully, but in the end it comes down to my dad not being supportive of my career choice and selfishly wanting me to do what he wants me to do.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n</td>\n",

My parents divorced early and I lived with my mom from 6-13 in Ohio, whereas I had been in Texas before. Anyway, When I was 13, I came home from school one day and my mom had been arrested for like the 5th time for doing drugs. But this time was permanent. (I haven't seen her since.)\\n\\nAfter that, my grandma drove up to Ohio from Texas to get me, and brought my dad with her. Then we drove back, and I moved in with my grandma. My grandma is awesome. Anyway, I found out shortly after moving in that my uncle would also be living with my grandma. My uncle is 40. He has \"mental problems\" as my grandparents describe it, so they use that as an excuse to put up with his bs, such as leaving messes everywhere, trashes my grandmas car, never having a job, and they said he will probably never move out because is isn't capable.\\n\\nSo that went on for about 2 years, and oh man I hated it. His blatant disrespect for how lucky he was made me so angry. He was practically sucking financial resources out of my grandparents for free because he was lazy. Two years of rent free life. That combined with the fact that he is an enormous jerk really makes me hate him.\\n\\nAfter those 2 years, my grandma brings up that my dad, back in Dallas (I live in a very small town about an hour away) has been living on the streets long enough, so she lets HIM move in as well. When HE moves in, he does the same thing as my uncle. Freeloading, whining, being ungrateful, and just generally being a drain and a pain in the ass.\\n\\nHaving to live with these two constantly makes me dread being home. It has made me really sour. I literally never smile when they are around, and I never speak to them. When they speak to me I just answer with quick one word answers and try to end the conversation as quickly as possible. My uncle still lives here, going on nearly 4 years (I'm 16.). My dad has been here for about 3 months, but he is no closer to moving out than he was when he got here. I am constantly reassured he will be gone as soon as he gets his first paycheck, but he doesn't have a job and I'm not holding my breathe. My grandma knows I am super unhappy with them being here, but she and my sister both say I am being a dick. They say that my dad and uncle are family, and I shouldn't hate them, that I should give them more chances.\\n\\nSince my entire life all of my family, besides my little sister and grandparents, have been drug addicts, failures, and freeloaders, I never really learned to value family. I just don't feel it. But I do feel intense anger towards both of these gents.\\n\\nSo there you go, reddit. Am I justified? Am I being unreasonable?</td>\n",

We don't have the same interests, the only time we speak is if something needs to be done or if a question needs to be answered, and just never really spent time together as I was growing up unless we were forced to (family vacation, ect). We do not casually chat or have deep conversations, the only time I can think of an instance like this was when I was checked into rehab for suicidal threats where we both broke down and promised to try and fix our relationship but that didn't hold up even a week after I got out. We would always argue and disagree until it got to the point that we just started ignoring each other even when we were in the same room. I can count on my hand the amount of texts I have ever sent my dad. Since I recently graduated and my younger brother just turned 16, my dad said that he would get me a new car and pass down mine to my brother. When we were having lunch (silently) after looking at some used cars, we got into an argument that lead to screaming. He got frustrated that I would be so rude as to raise my voice when he does all these nice things for me like pay for my college and buy me a car. I am thankful for these things but afterwords he asked me if I even wanted to have a relationship with him. I honestly didn't know what to say because I knew that I do not want to have a functioning relationship with him like I do with my mother, but he said that it makes him sad because he wants to have a relationship with me more than anything. When I got home I got into my room and burst into tears because of how bad I felt for not wanting a relationship but deep down I know that the emotional scars and 17 years of disconnect has really fucked me up to a certain extent but he doesn't know as I rarely spend time with him.

I have met her mother and her older sister and we are in a long distance relationship (about 230 miles) I see her 1 or 2 times a month on average.  That's the basics out of the way. \\n\\nAfter a year of dating I asked to meet her dad, she said no way not until I have a college degree. I didn't think much of it at the time but as we dated I really started working hard to finish and graduate. I am now just under a year off of graduating with a degree in Public Relations and I asked her if we could sit down and talk about where each of us are at in school. How she feels about in the future possibly sharing an apartment (makes sense financially), and also me meeting her father. \\n\\nShe got angry and shot me down, saying that she wouldn't even talk to me about it. I have tried to bring it up a few times but each time she says no or acts like it is some sort of interrogation. I understand why she is worried about her dad but its been 3.5 years, he knows I exist, moving in makes financial sense but i'm not set in stone on that, and she wont even talk to me about school just gives me run about answers.  \\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting to sit down and start making long term plans/goals. I'm 24 and am in the starting process of really looking at the long term of my life. I want to either move forward in this relationship or start to loosen it up so I can enjoy my last year as a college kid. I do love her but I can't put time into something that isn't going anywhere anymore. \\n\\nThe catch is this weekend I am going to town to celebrate her birthday that was last week. Is it to assholeish to talk to her this weekend about it? To be clear I do want to be with her and she is one of the few people I could see a future with...but I can't be with her if she wont communicate or doesn't have the same long term goals as me. \\n\\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for wanting to talk to my girlfriend about plans for the future on her birthday weekend even though she refuses to talk about it? \\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses, I have decided to lay off meeting the parents as that may be a cultural thing that I just don't grasp. I'm going to work on communication and if she truly doesn't want to talk then I will have to start thinking that this relationship isn't going anywhere.

I am 19 years old.\\n\\nMy friend Jeremy had a new years eve party at his house. His younger sister, Gretchen, had a few friends over as well but since they were juniors in high school at the time and we were in college, they weren't around us most of the night. I am pretty  drunk by the end of the night, and Gretchen's best friend Lola decided to ditch her young friends and join the partying college kids. Lola and I hit it off, and we are talking for a long period of time. She shows me her tattoo, we talk about how hard it is to find jeans that fit properly (we are both quite tall), the whole bit. I wake up the next morning and Lola is gone, and I was kinda disappointed. \\n\\nI get a text from Gretchen saying that Lola wants my number, she was just too nervous to ask for it the night before. I oblige, and we start texting. She starts getting very serious about things and wants to hang out really bad and asks how serious we are and where this is going (which I am fine with, and I find very attractive actually)I am then informed that she is only 16 years old, and I realize that a relationship isn't going to work if I have to go back for spring semester in a week. And even after that, she's still in another year of high school. So I tell her that unfortunately I can't do the long distance thing, especially from college to high school. We are at different points in our lives and have different priorities. She is extremely understanding, and very cool about it. Then a few weeks later, she texts me and asks to hang out one weekend that I'm home. I politely decline and say something would happen between us, and then I would have to leave again for school and it would be too hard. She says, and I quote,\\n\\n \"pantherlax56 I'm not trying to start a relationship, I just want to hang out with you.\"\\n\\nI again politely decline the offer. She texts me intermittently after that, and I say maybe we can get together over the summer when I'm home for while. She says that sounds good. The texting pretty much cuts off a few days later.\\n\\nFast forward to the summer. Im home from school, and I'm ready to party with my friends I haven't seen in awhile. So my other friend, Richard, invites me over to his house for some beers. We watch F1 qualifying, and start talking about girls. As it happens, Richard and Lola are good friends. He tells me that she has been talking about me non stop, and he repeatedly told her \\n\\n\"you guys will be a thing over the summer just wait\"\\n\\n because he couldn't deal with her constant mentions of me. We're both pretty drunk, and he says, \\n\\n\"hey dude, its Lola's birthday today. If you wanna make someone's day, text her.\"\\n\\n So I do. We pretty much pick up right where we left off and things start getting hot and heavy pretty quick. We start making sexual innuendos on a daily basis, talking about \"studying extra hard\" for her finals and making sure she's \"extra prepared\" for her male reproductive system test (she's in nursing classes). I think to myself: \\n\\n1. I expressed my feelings about a relationship awhile ago, and she understood\\n2. She told me she didn't want a relationship either, just to hang out\\n3. We are talking very sexually within days of talking to each other for the first time in months\\n\\nAnd I conclude that we both want a casual hookup FWB type thing. So I ask to hang out, she says sure. I ask if we can hang out at her place, she says there is \"nowhere to go\" (furthering my assumptions of a casual sex thing). So I say she can come over to my house and we can \"study.\" She says sounds great. She comes over, we have sex, she goes home. I get a text from Lola that says, \\n\\n\"so what does this mean?\" \\n\\nand I ask, \\n\\n\"what do you mean, what does this mean?\"\\n\\n\"are we casual or is this going anywhere?\" she asks.\\n\\nI explain that I made an assumption based on what I thought were obvious clues, and I apologize, but my feelings about having a relationship with someone far away and still in high school haven't changed in 2 months. I apologize profusely, and reiterate the fact that we already talked about not being in a relationship and just hanging out. I thought I knew what that meant, but I was wrong. She gets very upset, and doesn't talk to me.\\n\\nI have now come to find out that Lola explained (in graphic detail) what her and I did to Jeremy and Gretchen's parents. My best friend's mother apparently said that I \"hit it and quit it.\" So the next time I was over at Jeremy's, it was terribly awkward because Lola, Gretchen, and Jeremy's parents were all there. Everyone knew that we had sex, and then just quit talking. \\n\\nLola hates me, Gretchen thinks I'm a \"fuckboi\", and her parents think I intentionally \"hit it and quit it.\"\\n\\nAm I an asshole for assuming what I did?\\n\\nEDIT: I left  a few things out of the original story in the interest of keeping it short. When we met, I was 18, she was 16. When we had sex, we were both a year older (19 and 17 respectively). I didn't just cease communication with her as soon as I pulled out, as some seem to think. I simply meant that it was very awkward between us due to the miscommunication, and she made it clear that she didn't want anything to do with me anymore. \\n\\nAlso, if I could defend myself a bit: Sex is an act that involves at least two people. If she didn't want to, she could have said/let on that she wasn't into it. But I know that she wanted to, because she initiated it physically. I won't get into the gory details but she definitely started and continued to enable the act of foreplay/intercourse. This was also the first time we hung out in person, just the two of us. I don't know about you all, but if I plan on starting a relationship with someone, I probably wouldn't have sex with them on the first \"date\" or whatever you might call our little hangout mesh.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I would like to clarify that 16 is the age of consent in my state. Regardless of your moral standings, I am in the clear legally. Also remember that she was 17, only 2 years younger than me at the time.</td>\n",

The thing is, I wouldn't mind if these were just snide comments, but these turn into days long arguments over something like $11.

       "      <td>So I'll refer to my friend as Chris. Me and Chris have been friends for 6years, I'm 19 right now. We originally met in school when we were 13-14 years old. Back then like most boys, we did nothing but play a lot of videogames. We weren't your stereotypical Urkle-type nerd, but more the quiet bunch that played a lot of games and got along with nearly everyone. \\n\\nChris and me were part of a bigger group of 'core' friends. But since Chris and me had been classmates we knew eachother very well. I considered him one of my best friends.\\n\\nBack then I was out of shape aswell, needless to say me and Chris were really good friends and not the most popular in the school. As a kid with low confidence going through puberty, I 'dealt' with normal adolescent insecurities by being the nice guy. ( ~~sometimes to a fault when i look back at things~~ , definitely to a fault, I would let other people push me around )\\n\\n\\nDuring the next two years in school, I, then Chris respectivelly flunked a year in school. Because of this we ended up in different classes, and made different friends. I mostly hung out with my 'core' group, Chris more and more with a new group of friends. We were 16 at the time, still very good friends but hanging out less because of different friend groups. Soon after Chris made his new friends, he became attractive and popular. ( And more dickisch in my opinion )\\n\\nChris would never have time to hang out with me or any other friends from the original 'core' group anymore, since making new friends. This didn't bother me too much, people made new friends all the time during adolescence. \\n\\nI only started getting annoyed with Chris not having the time to hang out with me, when 2-3times a month he would show up to my place after school to drop of his stuff, so he wouldn't have to lugg it around when hanging out with his friends. I voiced once that I didn't like it that he would use my house as his personal locker, but let myself get pushed over since i was too timid and friendly. This went on untill we were about 18. \\n\\n\\nWhen we bothe started uni, Chris said he would have more time to hang out with his old friends now, since he wouldn't be able to see most of his then current friends. ( This always felt a bit fake to me, since it felt to me like our 'core' group got labelled as a plan B, for when plan A wasn't available )\\n\\nNow I'm a different person compared to when I was 13-16. I started lifting weights, grew till I was 1.88/6\"2, My 'face' had become attractive aswell. I started kickboxing aswell. All these things grew me a lot of confidence.\\n\\nThe straw that tipped the bucket... So me and some friends of the old 'core' group were hanging out at a quiet field with a nice view. Chris showed up aswell. ( Occasionally we'd meet when going out drinking/partying in town ). \\n\\n\\nWe sat in a cirkle and I was seated next to Chris. Chris started smoking and because of the direction of the wind, his smoke ended up in my face all the time. I stated this and asked him to either move, or stop smoking. He kinda ignored me and continued anyway. I sat in the grass for another 8ish seconds not really knowing how to make him stop since he wouldn't listen to me. So i pushed him. (We were bothe sitting in the grass next to eachother, this was more a one-armed light shoulder push then a full rage sparta push). Chris just laughed this off, and continued smoking again, he said that the only reason he let the smoke get in my face was because i reacted to it. Even though I didn't feel like I should have had to deal with this shit, I kept my mouth shut for another 15ish seconds whilst Chris continued to keep smoking. My other friends (and I guess Chris aswell) didn't really notice how serious I was with being annoyed with having constant smoke in my face. Well, I bursted, I stood up, yelled at Chris, called him out for all his shit, took my bike and left while my other friends were trying to calm me down.\\n\\nI guess the reason I'm mad at Chris is because he never respected me once he became popular, He would use me as a friend for when he needed one. \\n\\nEven after I became known as the attractive guy in my auditorium, he still wouldn't respect me. I always felt like he looked down on me as a friend. The worst part of this might be that I'm a confident guy, but I feel like a turn into a bitch whenever i stand across from Chris. Like I don't really care what people think off me, or wheter they 'respect' me or not. But for some reason I do with Chris, and I can't get over it. I feel like an idiot just being able to get so mad and even typing a whole story like this over something that is so trivial in my life. \\n\\nSo... Am I the asshole for yelling at Chris (because I guess i'm insecure when it comes to him) or is Chris the Asshole.\\n \\nTLDR: used to be an quiet, friendly, low selfesteem type kid. Had a very good friend who turned popular, and I feel like he 'used' and pushed me around as a friend, without ever standing up to him because of my low self esteem. We sort of parted ways naturally through school. By now I had become confident and popular myself. Was hanging out with some people including that particular 'friend'. He blew smoke in my face and wouldn't stop. I felt disrespected too much, and called him out on his shit.\\n\\n</td>\n",

I also had a friend that I've known for 15 years, and my father and his were best friends. Well, fast forward a couple years after I didn't have that 3 way because I ended up getting black out drunk at the college she went to and forgot about them, and she's engaged to my childhood friend, and she's pregnant. Now I'm a pretty liberal guy, and very open minded. She's very conservative. We're friends on Facebook and she posts shit saying Obama should be impeached and things like that, and I always like the cnn article of 182 things obama has done, and each one has citation. But then today she posted a picture saying something along the lines of marriage isn't about religion, or finances, and it's only about love. Then I posted something along the lines of saying it's wrong of her to sit there and say someone getting married because it's part of their religion, or making it a financial decision is wrong when she expects others to be tolerant of her views on it. She then proceeded to threaten me, and attack me personally. Which I ignored the personal attacks, and the threat because of my respect for my old friend. Then before I respond she tags him in it, and he calls me a douche for calling her on her shit. I responded by saying that I was happy for them (I'm not, she's a bitch and a slut) but that if she expects others to be open to her ideas about marriage she has to be open to others. She then threatened me again, and attacked me saying that my father didn't want me and I'm a failure. I don't talk to my dad by choice, and while I recently quit my job I have no debt, an she has student loans for a degree she didn't finish, and no job. I didn't say any of that though, nor did I post any of the pictures of her I have, nor did I tell him about the tumblr page she used to have that I got those pictures off of. What I did tell her is to thank him that I'm not going to flip out on her, and I blocked her. Then I messaged him saying I'm sorry things had to go down like that, and blocked him.\\n\\nPS I haven't talked to my dad in over a year and haven't seen him in about 2 and a half. He wasn't there growing up, and so me and this friend weren't best friends, but we were still friends.\\n\\nTL;DR Oldest friends slutty fiance doesn't like me, and we got into it. I ended up blocking her, and him, and lost my oldest friend. So am I the asshole?</td>\n",

       "      <td>This ended up fairly long but there is a TL;DR. If anything is unclear please let me know and I'll try to clarify.\\n\\nI am 23 years old, recently graduated from college, and currently living with my mother on the East Coast (USA). If it matters my parents are divorced and I am not living under my father's roof. Recently my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together in California. This is a good move for me career-wise because I want to work in the biotech/pharma industry.\\n\\nI ask my father for advice frequently but he also gives a lot of unsolicited advice. He says that this is because he has an analytical problem-solving nature that he can't shut off. He  thinks that I need to have interviews lined up in CA before moving there, otherwise I will drain my savings.\\n\\nIdeally I'd love to have interviews lined up before moving but I personally don't think it's realistic. Companies often don't take applicants seriously if their address is on the other side of the country. I did apply to a lot of CA jobs during spring and never heard back from any of them. I was afraid that if I applied to more with my East Coast address it would be a waste. My father then suggested I put down an address of someone I know in CA, but I'd have to be able to fly down for interviews on short notice, which would also drain my savings.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I picked out a short-term lease apartment and he is willing to cover rent and other costs of living until I am employed. We made a budget. I have $8000 in savings that will be used on the security deposit and my plane ticket. The rest will be emergency funds. I do not expect my father to bail me out financially under any circumstances. I am not moving to CA for around a month, but I have started applying to jobs using the apartment's address. My father wanted me to have interviews lined up before choosing an apartment.\\n\\nI fully explained my reasoning to my father and I can explain more of my reasoning if anyone asks. I do understand my father's concerns and I know he's trying to look out for me. I told him that I took time to think on his advice but I am not going to follow it and I would like to stop discussing it. He got angry and told me that was a very disrespectful thing for me to say.\\n\\nMy father thinks I was just too lazy to apply for jobs early because people in my generation have lazy attitudes. He said he felt it was his duty to \"slap that attitude in the face\". I found this very hurtful because I'd applied to tons of East Coast jobs before deciding to move to CA, so I'm clearly not too lazy to apply to jobs. At this point both of us were raising our voices. \\n\\nAt 9:40 during the argument I told him I needed to leave soon to feed cats I was pet sitting by 10:00. He wouldn't drop the argument and I reminded him I needed to leave several times. The cats have special diets and need medicine, so by 10:40 I walked away from the argument, telling him I was already 40 minutes late to feed them. This is especially where I'm worried I was the asshole. But in my opinion it's definitely an asshole move to not feed the cats.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I told my father that when he gives me unsolicited advice I will always listen and consider it. But if I end up choosing not to follow his advice I want him to respect my decision. His response was that this is very disrespectful to him. I ended up walking out mid-argument because I was pet sitting cats with special dietary needs and was already 40 minutes late to feed them. My father was aware that I had this responsibility. I am 23, not living under my father's roof, and not depending on him financially. AITA for choosing not to follow his advice and/or leaving the argument to feed the cats?</td>\n",

Never tell a mother she is a bad parent, now it seems that it's non-stop play time for her kids. Little does she know I have a 1000W 5.1 surround sound system that I have not put to good use since the move to these apartments. A day later, I cranked up the music about midday, it made the water in my glass vibrate, so i'm sure she enjoyed the booming bass just as much as I. That went on for half an hour or so before I judged she had enough. For the rest of  the day I was able to read my Game of Thrones in silence, but to my disbelief, the next morning was hell. I could literally hear the mother tell her children to play football inside because it was too hot outside. Really bitch? I had to take it to the next level. The blasting of my music lasted for hours at a time during the day, I even gave her a taste of it around five in the morning. I can tell you she did not love that by the banging on my door about 20 minutes later. I told her I like to get pumped before my morning runs. She cursed and purposely stomped back upstairs to her zoo that she called home. Later that day I continued my music festival in my living room for about 2 more hours.

I started working in the middle of a pay week so I only got about half of the pay that I would have expected, (The amount of money doesn't matter in this situation). So I set up my direct deposit having 65% going into my debit card, and 35% going into a savings account for books and other school stuff next semester. For some reason, the payroll office canceled my savings account before my first paycheck. No big deal really, I just got about $45 in my debit card and the rest came as a check in the mail a couple days later. So here's where the annoying shit starts to happen. \\n\\nThe day before I get payed the second time, a pay stub goes out online. When I got home I went to see how much money I was supposed to get and when I checked, it said my money was going into a credit card at a bank which I don't have an account with. My first though is that someone is committing fraud and it trying to take my money. This was at around 7 o'clock, so the bank and the payroll office were both closed and I went to bed pissed off. The next morning (Friday), I called the payroll office and what they told me is that my account number was denied and that the credit card my money was on was a student account that was made for me (I was never told about this until then). So I set up my direct deposit again and the lady on the phone told me that the two account numbers were different (Being the one before it got declined and the one i just entered) I checked what I just put in and it was correct. After I got off the phone, I called my bank and got on the phone with an extremely rude women who kept interrupting me and telling me I wasn't making sense. I was told to call back on Monday. Today is Wednesday. I got my other card with my money on it (thank god) and my direct deposit is good to go. However, I just got another email from the payroll office telling me AGAIN that the reason they canceled my information, was because my account number was wrong. I'm sorry if I didn't explain it before because i'm ranting, but the problem I have is, why did I get paid on my debit card the first week if my information was invalid? I was stuck between whether or not the payroll office or the bank messed up. I am leaning towards the fact that the payroll office messed up and just canceled my information for some stupid reason, causing all of these problems. I have been getting countless emails about it and I'm starting to get sick of it. I am about to call them and complain because it is absolutely ridiculous. Am I the asshole for wanting to call them back because they have been messing with my shit?\\n\\ntl;dr Am I the asshole for wanting to complain to my payroll office for fucking up my pay. \\n\\n\\nEdit: Ended up not calling.

I said \"No\" because I knew it would be awkward for pretty much everyone. Nate and I agree we'll hang out at my house for a bit, and then figure out something to do.\\n\\nI go and pick him up from his house, and as we're driving back to my house, Abby calls him and says she and Jane are buying ice cream from dairy queen and asks if we want any. Nate immediately says \"I'll have a Reese's and Josh will have a chocolate.\" He didn't actually ask me. I tell him I don't want anything. He offers to pay, and it's not worth arguing, so I turn around and start driving to Dairy Queen.\\n\\nWell, they were actually 45 minutes away at a different dairy queen. I drive there, just to not leave them there.\\n\\nWhen we get there, Nate bails, and says he was kidding about paying for me. I pay up, but he knows I'm starting to get annoyed.\\n\\nWe then go into a Target to kill time. It was awkward. Very awkward. Abby and I didn't really talk and it was a lot of silence. I didn't have a good time, and I told Nate, \"I wanna just go hang out with some other friends or at least go back to my house. This isn't fun at all for me. It sucks.\" He says \"Okay, we'll go to your house once we leave.\"\\n\\n15 minutes later as were walking out, Nate gets the idea in everyone's heads we should go play laser tag. I groan and give him an evil eye. \"It'll be fun. I promise it'll be quick.\"\\n\\nWe go to this place - I'll just call it the arcade - that has bowling, arcade games, laser tag, a ropes course, and an assortment of other things. We agree to just play a quick game of laser tag before hand. When we walk in, Jane says we should buy the unlimited pass and do a bunch of stuff. The unlimited pass is $25. They all now want to buy the unlimited pass, and Nate is trying to convince me to pay for Abby, and he'll pay for Jane. I say no, and convince them to just do the one laser tag game. I go up and buy my ticket first. The three of them... go up and buy unlimited passes even though they said they'd do just the laser tag game.\\n\\nWe all go to the laser tag first. \"We'll play laser tag first and then just a few games.\"\\n\\nAs we get right to the front, they see the ropes course, and run off and abandon me, which happened to be the time the door opened to the laser tag. I was first in line, and ushered in by the moving line. I end up playing laser tag by myself and then sitting there at the entrance for half an hour cause I couldn't find them (the place is BIG) and they wouldn't answer they're phones.\\n\\nWhen they do come back, I glare at them, and Nate utters a quick \"sorry\". As were walking out an hour later, we're thinking of something else to do. It's now been four hours. Nate wants to go hang out with some people in theater, since the show just got out. This is where I draw the line. Hanging out with Abby was uncomfortable. Hanging out with the people he wants to hang out with sucks. I hate them and they hate me. It'd be terrible. I tell them, that this night has been awkward and been mostly bad already. I'm not going to hang out with that group and make it worse. I say \"Either, we can go hang out with Simon and Bob (my two best friends), go hang out at my place, or I'm going home. You can find your own way home, or I'll drop you off on the way back.\" He starts arguing and telling me \"It'll be fun.\" I finally just say \"You know what, go with Abby and Jane. I'm leaving\". \\n\\nThey knew the whole night that I was not having a good time, and pretty angry that I was getting stepped on.\\n\\nSo I get in my car and drive home, leaving Nate to get driven around by Abby. This was at 9.\\n\\nAt 11:30, I get a call from Abby saying she got pulled over, and got a ticket for having too many people in her car (she just got her license and can only have one person in the car with her). She blames me since I left her with Nate. But, she had also picked up another person, and it's been 2 and half hours since I left. Now Nate, Abby, and Jane all are calling me an asshole for causing Abby to get a ticket.\\n\\n\\nSo am an asshole for leaving my friend after a crappy night for me, and then being a part of the reason she got a ticket?</td>\n",

And she sort of told me \"Well that's the job, just smiling and letting people in. You hate it, right?\" I didn't really, I just felt like a fucking cunt. So I rephrased what I'd just said, and she told me that she didn't need my help if I hated it. I don't argue unless I'm absolutely being fucked over, so I just agreed and shut up.\\n\\nThen she sent me downstairs with my friend (the husband) to spend the rest of the event. Yesterday he messages me over Facebook and tells me that he'd prefer that I act like a grownup (I mean I'm 20, so partially there at least, and from a shitass household &amp;amp; social situation that constantly insulted me my entire childhood, I've told him this) and stop whining and complaining when he sends me to help with stuff, especially involving his wife. I tested the waters, stating that I'd like the job better described to me beforehand next time. He says that I should just shut up and take advice like a grownup (btw literally the word he used) and do better next time. Once again I just shut up, because pitting myself against a wife never ends well.\\n\\nI will admit I complain probably significantly more than other people, it's one of the few ways I get relief from stress, if a shitty one. It's half the reason for this post. And I know this quibble is going to become a problem from here on if one of us doesn't address it (and guess what social incompetent me is worst at?). Am I the asshole here?</td>\n",

       "      <td>TL;DR my partner is upset with me because I won't watch the newest star wars movie with him. I don't want to watch it because it's almost certainly going to be a trigger for me because my brother was violently abusive, physically and emotionally, and the newest movie will bring all of this back up for me (explained in the description) when I've been trying so hard to move on. I've told him several times to take one of his friends so that they both have a good time but he thinks I should just come because it's only for a \"couple of hours every two years\". Should I suck it up and go or refuse?\\n\\nFirst: There's a reason why I'm not posting this in /r/relationships. They're paranoid and jump to conclusions and they demand everybody break up over the smallest thing. So please, no comments about my relationship because my partner has always been 110% respectful and loving. I'd just like an opinion about this one thing.\\n\\nMy partner loves Star Wars passionately. For weeks he has been asking me to watch the new movie with him and literally every single time he has asked me, I have told him that I don't like Star Wars (I can definitely understand why others do but the terrible acting and retcon distract me from enjoying it) and that I want him to take one of his friends (who all love it) because they'll enjoy it more. He gets hurt and says he wants to share his excitement for it with me.\\n\\nHere's the thing. My (26) brother was very, very abusive towards me for the first nineteen years of my life (I'm now 23). He regularly beat me, pulled knives on me (my childhood bedroom door had stab holes in it because he came at me with a cleaver and I only just got it shut and locked in time), spread rumors about me at school so I wouldn't have friends, screamed at me, encouraged me to self harm and commit suicide, and destroyed my prized possesions. All of this while crying loudly. For nineteen years, this happened literally about three times a week. I am not exaggerating any of this. He did the same to my mother and even blamed her cancer death on me (go figure). He is crazy and delusional and I have cut him out of my life. He is not mentally disabled, but I assume he has an undiagnosed mental illness.\\n\\nI'm still fucked up from this. I'm doing my best to move on but some things scare the shit out of me (I'm very resistant to using the word \"trigger\" because of how Reddit gets angry at anyone who says it but that's pretty much what it is) like if someone gets angry and screams suddenly, if I see a child throwing a tantrum, and if I'm forced to be around things that my brother destroyed. Star Wars comes into this because he destroyed all of our Star Wars toys in a fit of rage while screaming at me and trying to hit me. I can handle myself fine with seeing Star Wars merchandise and references and posters and stuff of course, but being trapped in a stuffy dark cinema for several hours being forced to watch that movie is different and will fuck me up. **He knows the reason why I don't want to watch it. I finally told him the true reason last night (after weeks of saying i didn't want to watch it because i hate the franchise) and since then he's been very distant and hurt but still says he wants me to watch it since it's only a few hours.**\\n\\nHe's upset and keeps going on about how he just wants to share something he loves with me. He doesn't want to go with a friend because he lost contact with them when he started a new job a couple of months ago that means he doesn't have much spare time. I know for a fact his friends would love to go with him and he would absolutely have the time if he didn't see me for one weekend.\\n\\nI know he loves me and is genuinely sad that I'm so resistant to enjoying something with him. I also know how weak and pathetic I  am by not being able to suck it up and go watch it. In my defence I only got away from my abusive brother in 2012, after nineteen straight years of him attacking me three times a week and it's going to take me longer than three fucking years to be completely okay after something like that.\\n\\nI'm thinking of the following options: \\n\\na) I email him more details about exactly what my brother did to me, because at the moment my partner just does not seem to get it even though he knows the overall story, and hope he realises just how badly this will hurt me. I'm worried this will be guilt tripping though.\\n\\nb) I harden the fuck up and go and not complain. This will essentially be bottling my emotions up though and he and I have always sworn to have a communicative relationship.</td>\n",

After a bit of a discussion over how dumb that was, he told me that he would not be able to pay me my 6k back, but he would instead send me $200 every fortnight until it was repayed, so rather then me getting my money back within 30 days, I am facing the realization of not being fully repayed for 30 fortnights (13 months).\\n\\nSo REDDIT, would I be the arse hole for asking him for my 6k by the end of January, with some sort of ultimatum, or should I just let it slide, knowing that maybe he can not afford the 6k and can not get the money off of anyone else.\\n\\nP.S\\nI have lent him 2k in the past to buy a new computer, which he payed me for within two months.\\n\\nP.P.S\\nMy savings was growing rather high, and I had began talking to people about either investing in stock or getting into the property game, and thought the month wait would not matter, but not I completely regret this decision.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nI lent a friend $6000 who said he would repay it within a month, after spending the money, he tells me that he can only afford to repay me $200 a fortnight until it is repayed</td>\n",

This evening my dad's gone out to the pub and to a restaurant with his friends while my mum has gone out with her friends too. They also went out last night to a friends house and I had to make something for myself as usual. I was a little mad at them and told my Dad that I wanted a fully cooked meal but he told me to just have leftover food from Christmas.

       "      <td>Happy new year, reddit.\\n\\n\\nMy new year has not been very happy.. \\nTo start off, I am 18 years old and live in Australia. Tonight, I went out with 4 friends of mine. 3 of which I have known for years - one of which I have known for months, only meeting him about 3 times, but have come to become good friends with him. Let's  call him Bill. Anyways, Bill does \"graffiti\". By this, I mean he writes the word ,\"Anarchy\" or someshit in some stupid messy handwriting. There is nothing artistic about it. \\n\\n\\nAnyways, to cut a long story short, I was invited to a New Years Eve party where I only knew 4 people out of about 70. 2 of these 4 people, I hadn't seen in years, and only knew them through primary school. My other 4 friends, including Bill, knew nobody. I knew that Bill had spray paint and markers on him, and to be honest, I couldn't care less if he graffitied some random public property. Bill asked me at some point throughout the night if he should tag the house. I told him no. That was a stupid idea. He agreed. \\n\\n\\nHours later, I had left the party and was on the other side of the road of the house at a park with a girl I had met. We heard very loud, angry shouting, and the host kept calling the girl I was with, asking where she was and that she had to talk to her urgently. I thought nothing of it, as it was already 1am, and new years was over. I thought it was a fight between a few blokes and the rest of the party came out to watch them punchon, as we could see that the entire party had emptied onto the street. \\n\\n\\nMe and the girl hurried back, and as I walked back to the party, I could hear people talking about graffiti and tagging and how someone had tagged a bunch of cars.. Turns out my mate, Bill, had stupidly decided to SPRAY PAINT his stupid tag on the inside of the house and tag a bunch of cars, including the owner of the house and their uncle's car, outside with his whiteboard marker (luckily this was able to be removed easily).\\n\\nI walk back inside the house to get my bag, and as I try to leave, the bouncers, parents and brother and sister (hosts) of the party confront me. The bouncers intimidate me, saying they know that I know who did it. They say they want his name and to don't fuck around because if i lie, they will call the police and find out the truth the hard way. At this point, i am shaking because I had no idea how serious this was, but was starting to realise.\\n\\n\\nThe entire party had been kicked out and forced to go home. I reluctantly (I didn't want to see Bill get in trouble, but I had no choice) told them his name and the bouncers said ,\"Don't fuckin' lie. We are gonna search him up on Facebook and if you're lying you're in trouble.\" They cant find him at first and accuse me of lying, but I was telling the truth. Eventually they find him and at this point I have already apologised about 50 times to everyone around me, saying how I am so sorry for inviting them and how I had no idea he would do such a thing (I claimed that I had no idea he did graffiti, but I knew he did. I thought there was no point in saying I knew he did graffiti, as it would invalidate my word even though I was telling the truth - I truly had NO idea that Bill would do such a fucking stupid thing after I had told him not to...)\\n\\n\\nI continued to apologise as I wholeheartedly felt extremely guilty.. I could see everyone was very upset at what had happened. I was told to go home and I did. All of my friends had bailed, including Bill and I walked home, alone. I messaged the hosts of the party, saying that I was so sorry for what happened and how I would take full responsibility if the police could not contact Bill. They responded saying that their entire family was very, very upset and the mother and daughter were crying uncontrollably about everything that had happened. They told me to contact Bill and let him know that the police will be contacted if he does not go and apologise in person. I messaged Bill and told him what the go was. He said he understood and he was sorry (just to me). I'm not sure what he is planning on doing. He knows they know his name and school, so he'd be stupid to not go and apologise. \\n\\n\\nAm I an asshole for bringing Bill along, even though I had no idea he would do such a thing?\\nThanks, and have a happy new year :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello. This has been on my mind for a long time ever since I did the deed so to speak. Over the summer I ended a relationship with my long term SO. I know for a fact that it wasnt a very good break up for her at all. Just wondering what the community thinks. I am so sorry this is so long. I donโt want to give a half story. Sorry!\\nBackground:\\nShe (19F) and I (19M) had known each other since beginning of high school. We dated on and off. 1st time was sophomore year and it ended badly. Went on dates every weekend, did typical BF+GF stuff [;)], but she didnโt want to advertise it at school. Thatโs fine whatever. After 6 months my friend said he saw her with another guy at lunch. I confronted her about it and she said she didnโt know her and I were in a relationship. Whatever. I moved on.\\nSeveral months passed and we got together again. I made it \"official\" or whatever (dating is confusing) and we were fine. I get a text randomly out of the blue one day saying she wants to end it, but won't give me a reason. She had a 4th of July party the next night that I was still invited to, so I went. Saw her there with her new guy. Confronted her again and she said that he was her 1st love and wanted to see if he changed (Irony is a bitch), but didnโt want to cheat on me. Needless to say I was pissed and we never spoke for 2 years I think? Fast forward to junior year. I left half way through the year to become home schooled. Got an email from her randomly apologizing for everything she's done to me, and wanting to reconnect. My thought process was \"She's matured a lot, Iโd be fine to give it another chance, but no plans on dating\". Well one thing lead to another and we ended up back in the saddle together.\\nCollege:\\n2.5 years was our last stretch. We went to the same college and lived together after our 1st year at the dorms. We fought here and there while at the dorms, a lot of which was her not being able to communicate to me at all. She couldn't tell me if something was wrong, what her opinions were on certain things, or make decisions on absolutely anything. Every argument I defused the best I could. We never had weeks of no talking or stupid passive aggressive shit, just arguments that resulted in her crying a lot for fear she would lose me.\\nI did always communicate if there was something wrong between us. Mainly her inability to communicate, how she didn't seem to care about money, and she seemed to put herself first. I had to help her with everything regardless of what I was doing. I had to help her pack, get on her ass about getting ready to go, and had to help her study, but with very little reciprocation from her. Most things were defused but then we moved into together. Now she had brought one of her horse to college with her. I was against this from the start, but I never argued with her about it. Her animals are her responsibility, and I understand itโs emotional. I was annoyed when she said she couldnโt give up her horse because it means too much to her. I had quite a few pets but I found them all homes, because I know college is a large financial and time burden. It was hard but I did it.\\nMoving in:\\nWhen it came time to move into together I let her really find a place. She had to look for a place to house the horse on the property, because she just COULD NOT drive to her horse, and she would not budge on that fact. I helped with a large list of places, that horse boarding, but not knowing what was needed she had free reign. We ended up moving in to some duplexes on the same boarding facility as her horses (she had brought down another one of hers and her mini-horse).\\nThat was hell. I found out she had no plans to get a job before moving into there and only got one out of luck at the boarding facility on site. She said she didn't have time, while I was working 2 jobs and other EC activities. We had to share a bedroom, and I was not happy. She had to have her massive waterbed (9ft by 4 ft) in a 10 ft by 10 ft room. She could have her things, but I was limited in what my things I could bring. I was technically not a resident there, the landlord was cool with us, but I was told if the city inspects it then I am not there. And on top of that we were 30 minutes away from the campus, with 1 vehicle (mine), and then she brought her dog with her that during the school year we would have to come back and check on twice a day. Our gas bill, with me driving to work alone was $300 monthly.\\nSo shit got bad and we argued about the same stuff. She couldn't talk to me about anything, her still being absurdly dependent on me for everything and just general day to day bullshit. This was not 1 way either. I was told that I get frustrated easily and I curse a lot when I am mad. So I watched my words when I was upset, and tried not to be frustrated, but honestly it was just her bullshit that was making me mad. So it progressed and these fights kept progressing. Nothing breakup worthy by themselves, but all together it was a mess.\\nThe Trip:\\nThen the catalyst. I took a trip to big bend for 2 weeks at the end of summer. I actually convinced her not to go, because I knew she couldn't handle the hikes, I didnโt want to hear the complaining, and I know she was going to be worried about the animals. I admit it was a slime ball thing to do, but I was thinking for myself. I didnโt tell her those reasons but she agreed to it. Definitely an Asshole for that. but I digress.\\nGot into a huuuuge fight the day before. I was still planning, packing etc. and we had to go home (3 hrs away) for a few days leading up to the trip. She HAD to see her family and whatnot. So I got what I could done and told her that we will just have to leave early on Sunday (trip left Monday at 6AM). Then it came. On Saturday she had a bitch fit at me because she NEVER gets to see her family and I wanted to go see my grandparents. We went home at least once a month and we both slept at her families house. I would see my family for 2-3 hours tops at a time. Then Sunday came around, and she was upset because I wanted to leave at 10AM to pack and get things ready, plus go to the stores. That was too early we fought and ended up leaving at 5PM. It was Sunday evening in the bible belt. Nothing was open when we rolled back into town after fighting for almost 3 hours. I just let it go not wanting to be mad at her before leaving on a trip. Next day we ride over there so she can drop me off. There was around a dozen other people there for the trip. She starts going off on the people Iโm going to hate on this trip. Rude, and wrong. I ended becoming really good friends with the ones she pointed out.\\nOn the trip I did a lot of thinking. Only got 4 hours of sleep a night from this. Talked to a few unbiased patrons and came to the conclusion that I should end it before it hits a breaking point. Didnโt want to end it on too bad terms. And she really was a good friend. Get back from the trip and that just escalates quickly. She pulled up and was pissed because I didnโt run down and lift her up out of the truck and swing her around or something (her words not mine). I just got off of a 10 hour van ride and had pulled my shoulder on the trail. I explained but she was still pissed. She then got more pissed that I was waiting on someone. One of my new friends on the trip had forgotten her stuff, so I was waiting for her to come back. She did I brought it to her and hugged her goodbye. My SO believed that I was acting tired around her just so I wouldnโt have to do anything, and I was suddenly energetic around my friend. We argued until 4AM. Next day I went out and found an apartment, and ended it with her that night. Had my bags packed up and I told her I wanted to end it before I end up hating her. 1st words out of her damn mouth were โI donโt know what Iโm going to doโ. She cried and what not and then came all the bs. I was told I was emotionally manipulative, and unreasonable. I did this 5 days before school started again and that was apparently too much shit for her. I was told that I should have done this during school when classes had settled or during the winter break. I merely contested that I could not lie to someone for months about how I feel especially in relationship that was failing. I also contested that there is no good time for a breakup.

I apologized for how things ended and how I didnโt want to fight as much. We had a lot of history together, that I donโt think was wasted. She kept throwing in there the guys she was hanging around and how she kissed the bassist of LA GUNS. I donโt know if I am over analyzing or sheโs trying to make me jealous. Iโm not a jealous type at all.\\nNow this is a me rant, but she really did love me. She did everything in her power to make me happy, and she still is, in some weirdly disconnected way my best friend. I had a lot of fun with her in between the fights and I do miss a lot of things. Things were not 24/7 bad between us, itโs just I saw that where it was going and didnโt want to end up enemies. I just want to know am I the asshole here for crushing her heart and doing so right before school started?</td>\n",

Honestly, I'm uncomfortable with that fact - not the fact that he's gay but that he's sexually attracted to me. I just want to say now that I have 2 other good friends who are gay and I hang out with one of them a couple of times a week when I'm back in my home town and it's not awkward in the least - because why would it be? I don't give a shit that that friend is gay.\\n\\nMy housemate though: Sometimes when we're watching TV I'll look over and he's staring at me with a distant smile, for example. Whenever I make even a shit joke he'll laugh so loud and stare at me with some proud, longing expression that a wife would give to a husband she loves. It seems like he's always just trying to get attention from me and always seeking a positive response for every little action. Because of this, sometimes when he does little things that he obviously expects me to make a comment on or acknowledge I just stay completely silent. Last week I signed up to a friend's university research project data gathering session, and he came back to the house today telling me that he signed up for it as well. That's fair enough, I suppose, as we're mates to an extent but before I signed up for it he was laughing about it and saying 'no way I'm gonna sign up for that'. It just seems like he's always trying to be close to me and it kind of weirds me out. I like being by myself and to be honest it pissed me off that I don't get to do this thing by myself now.\\n\\nHe knows I'm straight, and he knows that I'm not interested in him in the least, apart from on a friendship level. But it's becoming hard to treat him the same as my other housemates because if I'm too nice then he just starts again. He'll start with the 'Oooh, thanks man, you're so niiiice :)\" or if we go to the shops he'll be like \"our first date, I'm so proud\". Whenever he makes a comment or something that conveys his attraction to me I generally just tell him \"shut the fuck up\" and change the conversational topic (but try to keep it civil on the new topic). It's rarely a direct comment but more often indirect one.\\n\\nAll of us in the house enjoy mutually abusive (in a jokey way) relationships, but I find myself being very minimally more cold towards him than my other housemates - it's as if I subconsciously feel I have to make him learn that there's nothing about me to love and I'm trying to get him to dislike me. However, this is a double-edged sword because one of the reasons he's into me is because I'm a tall guy and forceful / purposeful in my words and actions - he is really into my 'presence' apparently (he's a small guy and kind of obsessed with height).\\n\\nIt should probably be noted that I'm really bad with relationships of all kinds - I find it very hard to connect emotionally with people and struggle to generate and keep meaningful relationships with anyone; even my family. Even conventional, 'normal' relationships confuse and tire me. I'm 22, in my final year of university and haven't had a girlfriend here. I'm good looking and girls like me but don't go through the stress of getting with any and haven't brought any back to my house while we've been living together. Maybe he thinks (or hopes) I'm a closet homosexual and am just repressing my feelings? Although I doubt it as me and my other housemates have common conversations about certain celebrities on TV etc. and how we think they're hot.\\n\\nJust wanted to get this off my chest and ask you guys if I'm being the asshole here.</td>\n",

He's recently (in the past year) gotten his license, and is now on his Green Provisional (Where we live you have Learner license, Red Provisional and Green Provisional and then your full license).\\n\\nPreviously, I've called him out for creeping up over the speed limit when I'm in the car, to which he responds by slowing down, but protests or attempts to excuse it, each time. I used to think that was just his insecurities about someone chastising his actions (he's got middle child syndrome bad, and it's exacerbated by the fact that his family don't actually relate to him except to tell him when he's done something 'wrong'), and we're working on that. He's also admitted to speeding ('But not by much!') when he is driving late at night.\\n\\nWe've argued about this previously, and he knows I am very wary of bad driving habits (the city we live in has demonstrably the worst drivers in the country, with a young adult motor vehicle mortality rate that is nauseatingly high - one of our local politicians actually likened it to a meatgrinder). Every time, I've gotten so angry with his casual attitude and responses that I've had to tell him to drop the subject.\\n\\nAnd so, today has been... Challenging. Our university is doing a cross discipline theory unit, our lecturer doesn't know the material, so he and I are both frustrated by that. Furthermore, we have to do a group project which essentially doubles both of our study workloads.\\nOn top of that, Allan has been stressing over his personal assignment for this trimester, and is in a position of not really having any inspiration/a non workable concept that he's struggling to turn into a viable project. He's been sleeping badly, and has contacted his lecturers and tutors but then failed to follow up with a meeting or communicate effectively with them about his problems. \\nSo he's irritable and anxious, which he then inflicts on me, to which I respond by calling out his behaviour. I apologise for snapping at him, he apologises and acknowledges his behaviour, we move on. \\nBut today has been one incident after another, which has left both of us rather irritated. \\n\\nWhen I returned home, he'd messaged me to tell me he'd gotten a speeding fine for being 7km/h over the speed limit (want to mention, being under/over speed limit by 5 km/h here is an offense). It's dated from Valentines Day, near my suburb, where he'd gone from work to a local supermarket to pick up desert, and then sped to my house. He has no points left on his Provisional license, and it's a $100 fine. I'm happy to help him pay it off, but it's just the perfect end to an overly shitty day.\\n\\nI said I'd help him pay off the fine, and his response seemed to lack any sort of acknowledgement of the fact that he'd done something wrong. \\nSo I did something very stupid. \\nI asked him to be more mindful about his speed. I really shouldn't have done that. I just hoped he'd change his attitude or behaviour now that he had actually been fined for it. I worried, because it seemed completely bizarre to me that there was no contrition or recognition of his error. And usually he's VERY good at acknowledging when he's been at fault.\\nImmediately, he made the excuse of 'I'm 7 km/h over'. \\nI nearly lost my shit, but told him I wouldn't argue about it with him, that even from a monetary perspective, he shouldn't be doing it, and that we should drop the subject. \\nHis response was 'Forgive me for not sitting perfectly on the speed limit at 9 PM on an empty street on a Sunday that's also Valentines Day.' \\nI told him 'It could be my birthday, my funeral, don't care.'\\nI then told him I loved him and that he should go rest - he hadn't slept more than three hours, and I just needed to leave the conversation because I was furious. \\n\\nAfter all this, he literally has tangible evidence of the repercussions of his behaviour - which has potentially more dire consequences than a fine and a slap on the wrist - and he's trying to justify his actions by making it my fault.\\n\\nNow I just feel kind of hollow and disappointed with his reaction, and I totally admit I shouldn't have taken the bait, I shouldn't have started an argument with him about this shit. \\nI'm hoping it was the shitty day, the aggravation, exhaustion and stress, and getting this crap news on top of all of this, and that he's just operating from a crappy headspace.\\n\\nSo I know I am the asshole, but I just want to know if I'm the only asshole in this situation.\\n\\nTL;DR I'm an asshole, but do I have company?</td>\n",

I mean, I have no reason to say no other than just not wanting to...\\n\\nEDIT:\\nWe do live together at our mother's house. It's only 20 minutes from my University so I thought \"Why not save money for a few years?\" My father, who is not my sister's dad, pays for the insurance on the car, but both he and I are on the title because he lives in another state and I had a police officer stalking me because the car was still registered in his state. He gave it to me towards the end of my sophomore year of high school. He pays the insurance and for emergency maintenance, but I pay for everything else. One of the conditions though of me having his car was that no one other than me and him, and of course my mother (because she's my mother and I will always respect what she asks of me), can drive it. Also, due to my sister's driving history, I don't really trust it anyway. As for why my sister doesn't have a car, my mom got her a car when she was in high school, then she went off to college and kept parking in places that she wasn't supposed to and kept getting it towed. Finally, my mom got tired of it and took the car back from where it was sitting in a tow lot about to be sold for being there too long. My sister leased a car, got into an accident. Got another crappy car, had another accident without insurance, then got into some legal issues. Ever since then, and after moving back home, she's been driving my mom's car to work and using me for rides. She's been living with us ever since. She also doesn't have any money to buy a car because she owes student loans and for stealing about $1,000+ from my mom's credit card. I'm probably driving her about 40+ miles a week. Alternatives would be Uber, or a taxi, but my thing is that she's making all of these plans with friends to go to all of these places and parties so why can't she get her friends to drive her to said places? Why make the plans and then ask me or my mom if we have the possibility of saying no and then she's SOL about getting to said places that she planned to go to? \\n\\nAnother note would be that my car is 16 years old and has almost 300,000 miles on it. So there's that, in case ya'll were wondering about the condition of the car.</td>\n",

My brother(27) lived in another province and decided he was going to move home around Christmas. He bought a house here so he has somewhere to live when he came back. From September to December I lived in his house and did my best to take care of it and even got furniture for the house, a TV, internet, cable, etc. \\n\\nCome December when he moved back everything was okay for a little while, but started to get upset at everything I did. I tried so hard to make him feel at home but apparently it wasn't good enough. He would get upset if I had friends over, or didn't clean enough, which was all I did almost everyday. He never cleaned his own house.\\n\\nThen February comes, he decided to adopt a giant 95 dog, which I was fine with. The problem is he was at work almost 9 hours a day, so I was stuck constantly taking care of his dog. I was a student at the time so I was home a lot. Then the dog started destroying everything. Mostly eating and chewing MY things. I expressed my concern to him and how I felt it was unfair I was stuck taking care of his dog and I didn't want to live my life around a dog. He didn't take it well and refused to get rid of this dog so I ended up moving back to my parents.\\n\\nNow I hear he's telling MY friends how I'm a jerk for moving out on him and he doesn't understand why. That really bothered me and I am not on good terms with him at all now. I tried to be very civil with him but nothing worked.\\n\\nI know this is kind of confusing, but does it make me an asshole?</td>\n",

More specifically, I have admittedly \"plotted\" to not be home when I knew relatives would be coming over our house, because I didn't have the energy to socialize and I wanted to go somewhere where I could just be alone. If I stayed home but in my room, my parents would be even MORE offended, because then it's obvious that I'm home and avoiding the company. But even with my leaving the house, they're STILL offended!\\n\\nI'm perfectly content with only seeing these relatives on holidays. My parents insist that I should make a concerted effort to see these relatives on a regular basis and that I should intentionally stick around when I know we're having company over the house, that it's rude not to, and that these relatives have now \"caught on\" that I'm conveniently never home when they're here and they're \"hurt\" about it.\\n\\nI think it's freaking ridiculous.

Weโve all worked together to paint, sand, and tile and now weโre at the point of getting the entertainment for this area. The Man Cave is, in theory, for everyone but in reality I will never use it. I have a nice TV in my bedroom, and am almost never home to use it as it is.

This is a thing for my 2 brothers to take advantage of, when their friends come over to watch a sports ball game or whatever. \\n\\nStill, even though I will not be using it I both offered and agreed to contribute my Xbox One to the project so that they can play their games and watch their shows. All thatโs left is acquiring TV, about $600-$1000 is what theyโre expecting to spend on a decent one. Well, now they (And by โTheyโ I mainly mean my dad) is trying to get me to go in about $200 on the TV. Iโve tried explaining that my contribution was the Xbox and games which I could have easily sold for more than that amount (Itโs the Halo 5 Edition) and do not intend on contributing any cash. Aside from the fact that shelling out $200 would destroy my entire 2 week budget, which is tight in the best of times, I will not be using this area at all.

Our apartment is a 4/4, so we each have our own bedrooms and bathrooms. All utilities are included in our rent except for electricity, which we split four ways and is usually very low from what I've heard. Two of the girls currently live there; me and another girl are replacing two other girls who are moving out.\\n\\nOne of my best friends \"Kayla\" is living in a dorm this year. She is working at a restaurant on campus, and needs to come up the week before school starts for job training. However, the dorm housing people didn't approve her request for an early move-in, so she doesn't have anywhere to stay for the four days before the dorms open. Naturally, I told her she was welcome to stay with me. I thought nothing of it since the only spaces I share with my roommates are the kitchen and the living room, and Kayla is incredibly shy so she won't be coming out there much anyway.\\n\\nMy roommates and I have a group chat that we made so we can see who has what for the apartment, decide what we still need, that sort of thing. A few days ago I texted the group chat and let them know that my friend Kayla would be staying with me from X date to Y date (four days).\\n\\nLater, one of my roommates \"Jordan\" replies, and her tone sounds really pissed off. It's probably pertinent to note that Jordan is one of the two who already lives in the apartment. I'd copy the whole text, but it was really long and pretty convoluted so I'll sum up. She basically said that that isn't the way we run things in the apartment, that we always get the other girls' permission before having guests, even if it's just for one night. She said she wasn't comfortable having a stranger in her home and asked me to tell Kayla she wasn't welcome to stay. The other two girls didn't say anything.\\n\\nI texted Jordan outside the group chat and told her that I wasn't going to uninvite my friend who needed a place to stay. I said I understand her concerns, and if I had someone who planned to stay longer than a week or so I would get everyone's approval first, but that I don't think I need her permission to host a guest in my bedroom for a couple days.\\n\\nJordan replied and brought up the electricity bill, and that she thinks it'll skyrocket with one more person staying there. (For four days?? I seriously doubt that, but I've never paid an electricity bill before so that's something I admit I'm in the dark on.) She said that if I insist on having an \"unwelcomed\" guest, I should pay more for the electricity bill that month. I told her we could talk about it when I move in in two weeks and didn't respond anymore.\\n\\nAITA for inviting my friend to stay in my room with me? I didn't think there was any way I could be since I have my own space, but now I'm not so sure. Is asking permission for every guest excessive, or is my roommate right? Should I offer to pay more for the electricity?</td>\n",

He never quite veered into physical with me, but he had beat on my mother several times throughout my life. I hated (And still hate) his guts, but was too scared to tell my teachers what was going on at home.\\n\\nMy dad eventually developed dementia, likely brought on by him drinking himself into it. He's had it for close to 10 years now (He was in his 50s when he was diagnosed) and my mom took care of him before she died. She did get POA over him, but she gave it back to him when she thought he had \"got better.\" (Yes, I knew that was fucking dumb. I miss her, but WTF?)\\n\\nI thought he had medicaid. So, my plan was when his condition worsened I'd stick him in a nursing home. However, I don't know when exactly, but he was switched to medicare because he (Or my mom, again I'm not sure when nor is anyone in the family) had allowed too much money into his bank account. That money sure as shit wasn't there when his condition worsened last year. I couldn't find anything to tell where, exactly, he had blew his money to.

We haven't worked for said company for years, but we stayed close since. She's seen me work my ass off during my twenties. Despite the age difference, she's never had her financial shit in order. I have ALWAYS made substantially less than her/then husband. She borrowed $40 during a time when I could barely afford to eat because she really needed it. Because of the petty amount (albeit I needed it), I didn't mention anything... until years later when she was bragging about how she pays everyone back. I just mentioned it out of principal. \\n\\nShe started working for a large finance company and gained the employment by a referral. She recommended me and I was first interviewed in 2008  before the global economic crisis mandated hiring freezes on the finance sector. I didn't get the job, but in all fairness, I didn't have experience. I ended up getting into banking two years later and worked my ass up into a lending role. Back in 2014, I applied on her recommendation. This was while I had banking experience (asset), but not yet lending. I was passed in favour of a candidate that did have just a little bit more, but was told it was a very difficult position.\\n\\nSometime last year, I was doing better financially. Same friend has always been poor at managing her money (she makes about 20k more than I do, but with similar expenses). I wanted to go on  a weekend trip.. she desperately wanted to go but couldn't afford accommodation but said she'd chip in with food. I was OK with that. We went shopping for groceries and she started loading the cart excessively as though we were there for a week. I didn't moderate her because she said she'd pitch in for groceries. The entire weekend came and went, and she didn't spend a dime but took money out for activities for herself. I was perplexed, and followed up when we went home. I was a bit aggressive about it because I felt exploited. She felt really bad about her behavior. She paid me back (not what I was expecting). Time goes on, and I let it go.\\n\\nI quit my job after carefully saving up living expenses for a year. I took a job that an old contact sold me on. Completely based on lies. Staff is absolutely terrible and toxic. I get bullied and alienated. Friend knows this and is excited to tell me mid June that same company is hiring. By July I haven't heard anything, but she reassures me that they're just busy. I feel like an asshole, but don't ask her specifics by mid July. I just vented that with everything going on at my new job, that I was feeling very discouraged that I hadn't heard from them. I was on the receiving end of some bad news that affected me economically and I briefed her on that. During this time, she hits me up about three different times for money. I lent her $100 with the expectation that I'd get it back on 07/29 (Payday). The other two times, she found other arrangements before I could get back to her.\\n\\nToday I decided to touch base with her to simply ask her thoughts if she thinks I should touch base with the recruiter that I originally spoke to briefly or if she thought it would be too aggressive for me to follow up in person with the hiring manager that might recall that I was passed over. I was feeling very confused, because the job requirements cite one year of data entry experience and a highschool diploma. I am an excellent candidate and knock off everything they're looking for, including assets.  She hasn't paid me back the $100 that she said she'd pay back on the 29th. So I thought that I wasn't being a douchebag with disrespecting her boundaries since it would seem like she clearly didn't have an issue with violating mine.\\n\\nShe responds back that sorry, they hired someone... maybe talk to the recruiter, she says, as per my original query. \\n\\nI can't help but feel pissed because she knew how desperately i was looking to quit my job.i only stayed there so I don't have to account for a failed job experience. I feel it's reasonable to keep your friend informed not only about when they started interviewing, but more importantly that they had hired someone. I'm not sure if those points are valid, or if it's the fact that I've lent someone money whose breached my trust with money. Kind of like.. well, you don't respect me, so why should I respect you? \\n\\nAm I being the asshole here for feeling like I've been wronged? Would I be the asshole for calling her out on the fact that she sat like a waiting duck with Intel while I was going through hell? \\n\\ntl;dr AITA for being mad at my long-term friend for keeping me out of the loop for a job that she referred me for when she knew i was holding out to quit my job?</td>\n",

She looked at me and said \"Will you help me buy a car?\" I said \"How?\" She replied, \"Just help pay for it.\" \"How much?\" I asked. \"All of it.\"\\n\\n             Now, before I continue, I should also make clear that our relationship is not that strong.

I should also note that she makes more than I do, but she has more bills to pay. So, continuing, I said, nicely, \"Babe, you know I can't give you all of it.\" I thought she was just joking and she'd say something like, \"Yeah, I know,\" but instead she asks, \"Why not?\"\\n\\n          I could hear her tone change. I respond kindly, again, \"Because I just can't give all of it. I can help a little.\" \"What do YOU need it for?\" Her tone becomes a little more belittling. I believed she was taking a shot at me for not having as many bills as she does. I was really astonished, because she's been hounding me to save my money and not spend it on anything, big or small. \"I need to save up for the semester coming up. Babe, you can't have it all.\" To save time, she goes on a tirade about how after six years, people would think I was being irrational for not giving her all of my money. I argued differently. Finally, she ends it with, \"I was just testing you anyway. I wanted to see if you would and now I have my answer.\"\\n\\n            I lost my shit as much as a normally passive person would. I said, not shouted, \"Are you kidding me? You know our relationship is pretty rocky, why would you test it so recklessly, if at all? You're the one who told me to start saving my money, so why would you expect me to give it all to you? I would if it were a dire situation, like getting kicked out or medical bills.\" \"It doesn't matter,\" she said, \"I have my answer. I can't imagine being with someone who wouldn't do all that they can for the one their with AFTER SIX YEARS.\" We then argued about who was in the wrong. We stopped and she laid down facing the other way, and I did the same. She shut off the TV and we fell asleep without saying a word.

This is a typical response from him and I have yet to do anything serious about it.\\n\\nSo I took him aside and told him he needs to work with me, \"I can't keep letting this stuff slide\". He got upset and told me that if I can't take a joke then \"fuck me\". \\n\\nSo I sent him home.  Now I feel awful lol. \\nAITA?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>This happened last year. Me(M19) and Nicole(F19) were on a trip with our classes to another country. Our classes stayed in the same hotel, for 4 days and 3 nights. Boys for themselves, and girls for themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNicole and I had known each other for a few months. She had just moved to our school and we became good friends in a short time. Nicole has a boyfriend, Jeff(M21), who's a very jealous type, but chose to trust that I wouldn't hit on(flirt with) Nicole. I wasn't interested in her anyways. Only as friends. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo at this trip, everyone got drunk, day and night, including me. But Nicole doesn't drink. So she was sober the whole time. She would lean up against me at night when we went to a mall or restaurant to eat. As in, her back, tightly up against my front. Often. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery night, Nicole would come into my room. She would lay on my bed, and I on my roommate's bed. He would always be out partying, so we had the room for ourselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery time Nicole left my room in the morning, my classmates would see her leave, so they're my witnesses. As their rooms were right next to mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last night, I threw up, drunk and dizzy. We both lay on the same bed. And she moved her hips forward and backwards, kinda humping my left leg. I held my hands around Nicole and put her on top of me. And she would, willingly, keep moving her hips in motion around my crotch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNicole leaned forwards at the same time so our heads would be right next to each other, while still moving her hips. I didn't make the move, to go for it. Nicole then got up and repeatedly said \"I can't do this, I have a boyfriend\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJeff called her while she was in my room, Nicole lied to Jeff and said she was in my room, so she could help me because I threw up and was dizzy and so on. She would then leave the room. We didn't tell anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast forward almost 6 months, Nicole chose to tell Jeff about what happened. But Nicole told a different story, that I tried to rape her on the last night, but that she managed to lock herself in the bathroom of my hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew Jeff, but we were only aquaintances. So I choose to travel almost 50 km to meet him, alone, and tell Jeff the truth. But before I managed to finish my first sentence, Jeff hit me. And started stomping my face while I lay on the ground. Spitting too. I didn't fight back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm 190 cm. Strong build. I could easily eat Jeff, who's short, tiny, and weak, but I didn't. I'm kind of a pacifist and also I felt a bit guilty. But I feel like his anger should've gone towards Nicole, and not me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter he left, I called Jeff. Told the truth. He acted like he believed me, and said they weren't together anymore. But after almost a year, I saw them, still together. I don't care that they are together or what not. I just feel bad for him. Nicole clearly has Jeff around her little finger. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm just pissed that I took a beating and he didn't get anything back. I can easily get my revenge. But I'm also kind of a pacifist, so it's a bit of a struggle, I guess. He has cousins from my city, but they don't dare to say anything to me, because I have people behind me, whom they are scared of. Jeff didn't knew this before he beat me. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter I took the beating, one of my boys threatened Jeff and he got scared. But I said to my boys that I don't look for revenge. My cousin then chose to speak with Jeff, and he cried this time over the phone. Scared. He isn't man enough to travel almost 50 km to meet up, in my city. I told my cousin not to do anything about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the whole situation, a boy, Sam(M20) from the same class as Nicole, came and told me that Nicole kissed him on his cheek before the trip. Sam told Nicole that he has a girlfriend, and that he did nothing wrong there (when Nicole kissed him on the cheek). Sam tried to confirm to me that Nicole is bad, and not me...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. And sorry for the bad English, it's not my native tongue. Feel free to ask any questions. If you didn't understand a part of the story, please say so, so that I may try to explain it a bit better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole? I just want this cleared up for me, so that I maybe might feel a bit better with myself. (I feel like this should maybe be posted in /r/offmychest?) Thank you.</td>\n",

He got so angry he told me \"If you do not come in tomorrow I will fucking destroy you\" I said whatever and turned around to leave.

Recently I was placed for this semester after asking for \"something within a couple miles\" of the university (since I'd have to commute on foot).\\n\\nUnfortunately, they placed me in a relatively high-crime neighborhood which is known (among my generation, not so much those above it) as a place not to be around after 3pm (especially around the local high school...which is exactly where and when I'd be).\\n\\nI'm a scrawny white guy, and for the record the neighborhood *is* primarily nonwhite- not that this matters; I've worked in primarily nonwhite communities before and had zero issue.\\n\\nHere's how the conversation went:\\n\\n&amp;gt;School: Your Fall 2016 fieldwork placement will be in the [redacted] school district for your observation hours. Someone in the district will be contacting you soon with the information of where and with whom specifically you will be working with.\\n\\n&amp;gt;Me:  are there any options that, given that I stated I have to travel there on foot, are a) closer, and/or b) NOT in such a bad neighborhood?\\n\\n&amp;gt;I hate to be picky, but most people who live around here know not to be in [town] around when school lets out. And I'm primarily concerned with my own safety here.\\n\\n&amp;gt;School: I am here to provide you with directions which will allow you to take public transportation to get to the schools in [town] school district. I hope that, following your experience in [town] school district, along with guided reflection from Professor [name], you will have a matured professionalism in regards to working with high-needs adolescents.  Until then, please know that it is my responsibility to ensure that all teacher candidates have clinical practice in a diverse array of school settings according to NYSED requirements.\\n\\n&amp;gt;Me: Fair enough. I hope that you did not take my concern as a racially motivated one, but rather one motivated by statistics and personal experience. Had [nice black neighborhood] experienced the same issues when I was placed there previously, I would have voiced similar concerns.\\n\\nI grew up in Queens, so I'm not exactly soft. But this school has been known to have racial and gang-related incidents in the (fairly recent!!!) past. I'm not a racist- but I'm not a moron either.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?\\n\\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I'm 21 years old and am *still* mistaken for a high (or even middle!) schooler by pretty much everyone.</td>\n",

He's 16, and I love him, but we oftentimes have it out verbally. \\n\\nWhat usually ends up happening is that we'll go a week or two getting along, and then he does something or gets an attitude about something that absolutely drives me mad. Then, inevitably; we end up fighting about it.\\n\\nHalf the time I feel that I'm not in the wrong. What usually incites these arguments is the fact that I tell him what to do, even when my parents end up saying the same thing I do in the long run. No matter what it is, if it comes out of my mouth he's going to have an attitude about it.\\n\\nWithin the past 2 days, we recently had to mow. I usually do a good bulk of the mowing, and he gets the trim. That's how it's been for a long time and it works well with both of our schedules. So I let him know that the mowing needs done (Yesterday) and he goes out to do it. Instead of mowing the trim however, he mows over everything I already did; saying it wasn't done (Even though you could very clearly see the difference of what was done and what wasn't.) I confronted him about it (Calmly mind you.) and he goes off and gives me his attitude as per the norm. Things obviously verbally escalate, and he tells me to leave (Even though I was calm the entire time.) And I know if I left, nothing would be done about it.\\n\\nFlash forward to today, and he made himself some lunch (School's out for today.) He always has a problem with making sure he gets his dirty dishes inside the dishwasher, and he usually leaves his messes for someone else to clean up. Today is my mother's birthday, and in knowing this; I knew she would be absolutely livid if she saw the mess he made. I went to his room (Again, calmly) To tell him to clean up his mess, and to do so very quickly. If either of my parents would see the mess he made of the kitchen, they would be pissed. And I didn't want them to get mad on my mother's birthday, and I didn't want to clean his mess up for him because he needs to learn to do it on his own.\\n\\nI go out to get a snack as he's cleaning, and I told him how we get along for a week or so and he becomes an insufferable douche. Then he tells me that he can't wait until I move out, even though it probably won't happen and he called me a fat ass with a superiority complex. All because I told him to clean up his mess, and mow his part of the lawn (Which hasn't even been done yet.)\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: Thank you so far for the feedback! I'll definitely try and tone down how much I tell him what to do.\\nI would like to mention/ask a few things however. I'm not looking to change minds, I genuinely want help.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter whether or not you ask him kindly to do something or tell him. A majority of the time he will get huffy about it. Even with my parents.\\n\\nThe only one he doesn't seem to have a problem listening to is our oldest brother (21). And they never fight whenever he tells him to do something, and he even agrees that I'm usually right on most matters.\\n\\nIs there any way for me to ensure that he'll start cleaning up after himself without sounding bossy? Or for my parents to do so? I don't want them to have to clean up after him, nor do I think I should have to either.\\n\\nOnce again, thank you for the responses! I'll keep them in mind next time a think a confrontation might happen. I'll definitely try to ask him instead of tell him more often, and I won't pester him about his chores as much.

I've been floating the idea past my boyfriend for a few months but yesterday I asked him in earnest to tell me what he thought. I sent a few pictures of styles I liked for his opinion and he confessed that he hated unnatural hair dyes, thought they looked trashy and that he really couldn't see himself liking any hair dye on me because he likes my natural color. \\n\\nI even tried photoshopping some different hair colors on a picture of me to see if that would change his mind (and because it was fun) but he still hated it. He told me I could do what I want, that he would still love me but that he prefers my natural hair and mentioned that if I had an appearance preference for him, he would do it. He told me he would still support me regardless and that it's my body to do what I want with, he was just gonna hate the way it looked.\\n\\nInitially I figured I would just not dye it and that would be that, but I'm having a really hard time giving up on the idea and I feel like I'll regret it later if I don't go a little crazy now while I have the chance. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just do it anyway but I feel shitty. I know if he wanted to do something like buzz his hair that I wouldn't like I'd be kinda disappointed too, I don't blame him at all for that. But does doing it anyway make me an asshole?</td>\n",

I will admit that it's unfair that most Christian holidays are Canada's federal holidays, but whatareyougonnado. Really I think no religious holidays should be federal holidays, and we should just get extra Vacation time in lieu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso worth noting that I am really trying to get into the Christmas \"spirit\" because of how dark and dreary the days are getting. I mainly see Christmas as a celebration with lights and decorations and being with those you love. My bf and I have planned a week long holiday to New York for Christmas and I'm very excited. She knows all this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis isn't the first time in the last couple weeks that she's ranted a little about Christmas' racism and exclusion.

She had responded positively with \"CHRISTMAS BABY!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo when she was ranting I smiled and was like \"haha, you can't hate Christmas thaaaaat much when my kitties are so cute in their Christmas sweaters!\" she kind of laughed and was like \"yeah, no I hate Christmas.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOk, fine, whatever. I didn't think anything of it. It didn't feel like a negative interaction to me. But I guess I really struck a nerve, because about an hour later she sent me an instant message basically saying \"I can hate Christmas and all the racist things about it and still like pictures of cats,\" but longer. I couldn't think of anything to say so I just didn't reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike, ok? Yes? Of course you can? I was just teasing... It wasn't like I was roasting her loudly in front of all our friends, it was just a quiet smiling prod, like we do sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, she hasn't talked to me since.

and plays for money. I live at home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and younger sister.\\n\\nThe hours my team and I play are between 6pm and 12am every night, although not for 6 hours continuously; it may be 9pm till 12am, or 6pm till 10pm, etc. and obviously I'm talking during those hours. Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\\n\\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\\n\\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this, all because I game competitively and am trying to win money from winning events?   \n",

My first roommate dropped out in October, and I got a new one to start he 2nd semester. He's the worst. Here's some of the undesirable qualities about him.\\n\\n* Incredible snoring. I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven't approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was \"have you told him about your snoring??\" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It's too loud not to know. This is fine, you can't help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I'm not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point...\\n\\n* He's a lazy fuck. He's very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it's because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn't do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn't help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality..\\n* He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn't stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a \"stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3\". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn't even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it.\\n\\nTonight though, I thought about something. I am talking about him a lot. I mean, he gives me a lot to talk about. However, I feel like I may be just as bad as he is, talking about him and the things he does with my friends and floormates behind his back. So, am I the asshole? Am I the asshole for talking about him so much and making such a big deal out of him, or is he simply the asshole and I'm responding to that?\\n   \n",

After I met her, I told my son (let's call him Tyler) that I thought Katie* was really sweet and smart and looked like she liked to eat.  Ok, I know that sounds bad, but Tyler's previous gf Dakota was borderline and refused to eat in front of anyone, and it always bothered me. I mean, if Tyler invites you over for a holiday meal, at least sit at the table and play with your food.  I guarantee no one would notice, but they will notice you sitting on the couch sulking.\\n\\nBut I digress, and I had to, to make the rest make sense.  About a year later, Tyler and Katie were hanging out here and he tells her what I said.  She looked kind of upset, and I know she thought I was making a comment about her weight, but I swear I wasn't.  I explained the whole Dakota situation, which she should've understood because she knew her and hated her with a passion.  I apologized, and explained what I meant.  I thought we were good.\\n\\nCut to **three** months later.  I'm at work and get a text from Katie's mom:  \"You're a fucking bully!  How dare you talk to an 18-year-old child like that.  You told my daughter she was a fat pig!\"\\n\\nWhat?  She texts back:  \"You're a sad pathetic cunt picking on a child.\"  This goes on and on.  I mean, I thought we were friends.  This literally came out of fucking nowhere!\\n\\nI tried to explain that I love to cook, and I love when people come over and they like to eat.  I really don't give a shit that the girl weighed 200 pounds.  Whatever.  My son loved her, so I loved her.\\n\\nSo am I an asshole for saying a girl looks like she likes to eat?\\n\\nEdit:  I forgot to mention that later on Katie's mom said she'd call the cops because I was harassing her.  I was ignoring most of her texts but at that point I texted her my address and said please, call the police.  Needless to say, she didn't.   \n",

A few days ago I got invited to the most popular kid(Phillip) in the grades house to play FIFA. No big deal. (Keep in mind I'm about middle class on the social totem pole) I have a clingy friend (Shane) that's relatively low on the social scale, but I still try to hang out with him. I skype him from time to time and while skyping, he asked me what I've done for spring break so far. I told him I went to Phillips house and Shane flips 2 1/2 shits. He freaks out and gets mad that I didn't bring him along. I said that he should chill and that I just didn't think of it. He said he's afraid that I'm leaving him, which honestly might be true. I don't want to completely leave him behind, but if it comes down to it I know I will. I told him that he needs to chill in social situations and try to curb the random shit he says or I won't be able to hang out with him anymore. (Shane has ADHD and doesn't stop saying random shit) Even still, I'm not sure if he's gonna be a casualty of me moving up. Am I the asshole for not hanging out with him as much, and not inviting him?   \n",

needed.\\n\\nOkay so for context, I'm a 21 year old male and my parents divorced about 3 years ago after many years of fighting. The divorce has been very \"messy\" with my parents constantly putting me and my 17 year old brother in the middle. Both my brother and I live with my mom and see my dad a few times a week. \\n\\nBoth my mom and I work at a hardware store together. My dad came in yesterday, like he usually does every now and then, looking at some clearance items in flooring and decided he wanted to buy some plus order some more. I told him I'd handle it all and call him later. I was told to put his items aside in the back and called him when I left work to let him know. He said he and his girlfriend would come in later that night to make sure she liked everything my dad was planning to purchase. \\n\\nMy mom was working at that time so I texted her letting her know they were coming to give her a heads up. Later my mom freaked out saying I shouldn't have brought him to the store, although he came by himself, and I shouldn't help him because of the way he treats her and she let everyone at work know that I don't live with him so if I let him use my discount I would be fired. She also threatened to not come home that night, but she eventually did really late.\\n\\nWe've been going back and forth all day. She thinks I should have told my dad not to bring his girlfriend in. My dad isn't a reasonable person so I don't think he'd listen, and I really dont see how I'm supposed to control what he does. I'm also upset that she blames this whole thing on me when it seems like it's a problem between them. I'm also not happy about her airing out our dirty laundry for all our employees to see and also threatening my job.\\n\\nI'm sorry this is so long but if anyone has actually read all of this and would like to offer an opinion it'd be greatly appreciated.    \n",

                                                                                            I will try to provide as much context as possible to present the story in an unbiased way.\\n\\nI come from a very conservative Christian family that raised me up through private school with the sole intention of me going to a 4 year college. I have always known that this is not the career path that I wanted to take, but in fear of disappointing them, I never told them and ended up actually attending a semester at a very nice college with the hope that it would grow on me. It only made me even more sure of my decision to quit and go into a field that only requires specific training. My mom was understanding and more supportive than my dad, who has never been the same since. Everything up to this point only serves as contet for the actual altercation. \\n\\nI was 18 when this happened. I had been home for a couple of months and searching for a part-time job by my parents' demand. I was sending out dozens of applications, but my complete lack of prior experience was making it difficult to even get a call back. One day my dad gets home from buying pool chemicals and tells me that they had a help wanted sign on the door and for me to apply online for it immediately. I didn't have a problem with this, so I went to the website to check the listing. It was a 21+ management position. Later, he asked me if I applied, and I told him that I was underage and not qualified so I didn't bother. This made him very angry, telling me that I would do what he said and to send in the application anyway. I repeated that I was 18 and have never had a real job before, much less a management position. We argued back and forth with the same thing for a bit and it eventually came to him saying \"I'll just apply for you. Give me your resume and be quiet.\" I said \"I don't have one, so you'll be sending in nothing,\" to which he replied \"Don't be a smart ass.\"\\n\\nA little more context to go with the first bit: I had heard my father curse only once before this, and it was after a severe injury, so this marked a serious escalation in the seriousness of situation where my family is concerned. The tone he used in saying this was very agressive and threatening, so my 18 year old reaction was that I wasn't going to take verbal abuse from anyone, so I said \"Was the language supposed to drive the point across harder?\"\\n\\nAnd this broke him. He got up from his chair and started walking toward me saying \"How about I beat your ass right now?\" My adrenaline replied \"Do you want to try?\" At this point my mom ran in screaming at my dad to stop, and he backed away from me but continued to the heart of what he was going to say. As best I remember it, he said \"I'm sick of your fucking bull shit and I'm sick of you. I pay out the ass for your school your entire life and you thank me by dropping out of college after one semester and pursuing a white trash job. You're an ungrateful little shit and it makes me want to leave this house.\" And then he stormed off. \\n\\nNow to the present, I'm still at home finishing up mechanic's school, and our relationship is still very awkward. We rarely speak. My mom has always sided with me on this situation, reminding me that his mother was severely bipolar and his father killed himself, so he probably inherited a mental illness and to not take what he says too personally.\\n\\nThe way I see it is that there were many times in the fight where either of us could have ended it more peacefully, but in the end it comes down to my dad not being supportive of my career choice and selfishly wanting me to do what he wants me to do.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n   \n",

I've been living in a house belonging to an old man in his seventies. Last night I was talking with him, which is always just me asking him questions and him answering. I finally asked him why he doesn't ask me anything or try to invite me to the conversation at all, and he told me that I was too young for my thoughts to be of any interest to him. I got upset with that and we had a brief fight followed by me going back to my room. I still feel like he's a dick. Am I the asshole?   \n",

my life hasn't been very fun. My parents divorced early and I lived with my mom from 6-13 in Ohio, whereas I had been in Texas before. Anyway, When I was 13, I came home from school one day and my mom had been arrested for like the 5th time for doing drugs. But this time was permanent. (I haven't seen her since.)\\n\\nAfter that, my grandma drove up to Ohio from Texas to get me, and brought my dad with her. Then we drove back, and I moved in with my grandma. My grandma is awesome. Anyway, I found out shortly after moving in that my uncle would also be living with my grandma. My uncle is 40. He has \"mental problems\" as my grandparents describe it, so they use that as an excuse to put up with his bs, such as leaving messes everywhere, trashes my grandmas car, never having a job, and they said he will probably never move out because is isn't capable.\\n\\nSo that went on for about 2 years, and oh man I hated it. His blatant disrespect for how lucky he was made me so angry. He was practically sucking financial resources out of my grandparents for free because he was lazy. Two years of rent free life. That combined with the fact that he is an enormous jerk really makes me hate him.\\n\\nAfter those 2 years, my grandma brings up that my dad, back in Dallas (I live in a very small town about an hour away) has been living on the streets long enough, so she lets HIM move in as well. When HE moves in, he does the same thing as my uncle. Freeloading, whining, being ungrateful, and just generally being a drain and a pain in the ass.\\n\\nHaving to live with these two constantly makes me dread being home. It has made me really sour. I literally never smile when they are around, and I never speak to them. When they speak to me I just answer with quick one word answers and try to end the conversation as quickly as possible. My uncle still lives here, going on nearly 4 years (I'm 16.). My dad has been here for about 3 months, but he is no closer to moving out than he was when he got here. I am constantly reassured he will be gone as soon as he gets his first paycheck, but he doesn't have a job and I'm not holding my breathe. My grandma knows I am super unhappy with them being here, but she and my sister both say I am being a dick. They say that my dad and uncle are family, and I shouldn't hate them, that I should give them more chances.\\n\\nSince my entire life all of my family, besides my little sister and grandparents, have been drug addicts, failures, and freeloaders, I never really learned to value family. I just don't feel it. But I do feel intense anger towards both of these gents.\\n\\nSo there you go, reddit. Am I justified? Am I being unreasonable?   \n",

sell my PS4 for a while and my brother (who was visiting for the weekend) offered to but it for 160 dollars. Now I'm pretty desperate to get rid of the thing since I've built my own PC and now never use the ps4, but 160 dollars is a laughable offer. I rejected the offer very quickly since I know they're going for about 340 on average on eBay. He proceeded to not talk to me the rest of the day and his last words before leaving the house to go to the airport was \"don't be so selfish eh?\". Should I have been generous and given the console to him for 50% off due to our blood relationship or was I justified in refusing the offer? For a little context, I'm 17, so money is harder to come by at my age then at his (he's 34). And it's not like I wasn't going to give the price a little leeway, I was willing to go down to 230. Anyways, enough excuses, tell me how it is.    \n",

My parents are pretty much divorced right now and my dad has been on his own for about a year now. I have visited him maybe once a month during this time while my brother has been staying with him almost every other week (he is 12, so no choice). Im starting to feel really bad for being a loner and not visiting. There is nothing wrong with my dad, I love him a ton. I just like to be alone in my room. My excuse this whole time has been that I have college and two jobs, which I do, but I still have plenty of free time. If my parents' roles were switched, I would just stay in my room at my dad's place. Am I being an asshole, or is this normal?\\n\\nAnd if you have any advice I would love to hear it.   \n",

                                                             I'm 20/f and live with my parents. I told my parents I would be out late and asked them to not wait up for me because I didn't know what time I'd be home. \\n\\nSo about 1:00 I get an angry text from both parents saying \"you're being extremely inconsiderate\" and \"you better get your ass home, now.\" \\n\\nI understand that I live under their roof and it's their rules, but I pre-warned them. Is 20 not old enough to stay out past curfew? I've never been a bad kid. I've always done everything I can to appease my parents. These last couple years though, it's begun to affect my relationships. No man wants to hear, \"sorry we can't go out tonight, my parents want me home by 9:00.\" So I've started venturing a little. Should I just stop until I move out?\\nAny advice on how to handle this is more than welcome!   \n",

context. Me, 22M, her, 20F.\\n\\nWe had a bit of a shouting match last night over getting the apartment cleaned up. I feel I shouldn't have to do as much as she's asking since I'm basically paying all the bills other than the internet/netflix bill, and I work 50+ hours a week.\\n\\nShe, consequently, only does nanny work occasionally as she can find it, so I only find it fair she should do most of the cleaning if she isn't working as often.\\n\\nI think I'm being pushed, when I'd expect her to do her fair share, considering I also do a lot of the dishes, vacuuming, laundry, etc. The least she can do is cook and clean if she isn't working.\\n\\nSo, who's the asshole here?   \n",

       I was promised a raise when I first got this job. The raise never happened. I have been working at this company for over a year and I was promised $14 an hour, only got $10. \\nSo when the boss asked for a new website I found a template and said it took me 60 hours to make.\\n\\nAbout 2 weeks later another employee showed me a website he made on wix and said \"Steve (our boss) Likes this website more than yours, and it only took me 2 hours to make\".\\n\\nAITA?   \n",

                    I really don't want this to come off as a whiny tumblr post, but here goes:\\n\\n\\nI'm pretty much of a \"rebellious\" nature. Whenever someone directly orders me to do something, I get offended by them for not asking nicely, so I get very tempted to do the opposite of whatever they tell me to do, or just call them out on it.\\n\\n\\nI'll try to cut it as simple as I can: I made a new friend this year that is pretty nice and all, but is incredibly straight-forward with everyone. He has told me on multiple accounts as a response to plans that I've proposed with: \"No, that's incredibly fucking stupid\". I'm scared I may have adopted his trait of being straight-forward with people, which is terrible because:\\n\\n\\nA. No one's going to change\\n\\nB. I've, if anything, separated myself further away from having more friends.\\n\\n\\nAlong with that, I've made the stupid decision of telling my dad \"jokingly\" that I \"never have plans because I don't have phrase\", and he took me up on it 100%. So now, whenever I'm a bit more \"straightforward\" with my dad and he doesn't like my opinion, he'll bring up the point of \"maybe you shouldn't say that so you would have more friends instead of slouching in your room every single day\" (which is true; 90% of the time, I'm in my bedroom).\\n\\n\\nA bit of backstory on my dad: basically, he's dedicated himself to always \"live happy\", and by doing so, makes a fool out of himself by calling me cutesy names (even though I'm 16, and obviously annoyed at them), attempting to spark conversations with dogs by repeating the phrase \"What's going on with you? What's going on with you?\" 27 times at a barking dog that would be on the other side of the room while people are directly looking at him, and doing the opposite of what you tell him to do (he always serves my mom an excessive amount of food, even though she always says that she does not want any more).\\n\\n\\nEither way, we've gotten into more and more arguments, and I don't know if he's being the asshole, or if I am.

basically starting my own life. Ever since I was little, I have never gotten along with my dad. We don't have the same interests, the only time we speak is if something needs to be done or if a question needs to be answered, and just never really spent time together as I was growing up unless we were forced to (family vacation, ect). We do not casually chat or have deep conversations, the only time I can think of an instance like this was when I was checked into rehab for suicidal threats where we both broke down and promised to try and fix our relationship but that didn't hold up even a week after I got out. We would always argue and disagree until it got to the point that we just started ignoring each other even when we were in the same room. I can count on my hand the amount of texts I have ever sent my dad. Since I recently graduated and my younger brother just turned 16, my dad said that he would get me a new car and pass down mine to my brother. When we were having lunch (silently) after looking at some used cars, we got into an argument that lead to screaming. He got frustrated that I would be so rude as to raise my voice when he does all these nice things for me like pay for my college and buy me a car. I am thankful for these things but afterwords he asked me if I even wanted to have a relationship with him. I honestly didn't know what to say because I knew that I do not want to have a functioning relationship with him like I do with my mother, but he said that it makes him sad because he wants to have a relationship with me more than anything. When I got home I got into my room and burst into tears because of how bad I felt for not wanting a relationship but deep down I know that the emotional scars and 17 years of disconnect has really fucked me up to a certain extent but he doesn't know as I rarely spend time with him. Am I the asshole?    \n",

been with my Asian-american girlfriend for 3 years, when we first started dating I was a terrible student. I have met her mother and her older sister and we are in a long distance relationship (about 230 miles) I see her 1 or 2 times a month on average.  That's the basics out of the way. \\n\\nAfter a year of dating I asked to meet her dad, she said no way not until I have a college degree. I didn't think much of it at the time but as we dated I really started working hard to finish and graduate. I am now just under a year off of graduating with a degree in Public Relations and I asked her if we could sit down and talk about where each of us are at in school. How she feels about in the future possibly sharing an apartment (makes sense financially), and also me meeting her father. \\n\\nShe got angry and shot me down, saying that she wouldn't even talk to me about it. I have tried to bring it up a few times but each time she says no or acts like it is some sort of interrogation. I understand why she is worried about her dad but its been 3.5 years, he knows I exist, moving in makes financial sense but i'm not set in stone on that, and she wont even talk to me about school just gives me run about answers.  \\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting to sit down and start making long term plans/goals. I'm 24 and am in the starting process of really looking at the long term of my life. I want to either move forward in this relationship or start to loosen it up so I can enjoy my last year as a college kid. I do love her but I can't put time into something that isn't going anywhere anymore. \\n\\nThe catch is this weekend I am going to town to celebrate her birthday that was last week. Is it to assholeish to talk to her this weekend about it? To be clear I do want to be with her and she is one of the few people I could see a future with...but I can't be with her if she wont communicate or doesn't have the same long term goals as me. \\n\\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for wanting to talk to my girlfriend about plans for the future on her birthday weekend even though she refuses to talk about it? \\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses, I have decided to lay off meeting the parents as that may be a cultural thing that I just don't grasp. I'm going to work on communication and if she truly doesn't want to talk then I will have to start thinking that this relationship isn't going anywhere.  Thanks so much for the responses I think I found one of my new favorite subreddits!    \n",

I am 19 years old.\\n\\nMy friend Jeremy had a new years eve party at his house. His younger sister, Gretchen, had a few friends over as well but since they were juniors in high school at the time and we were in college, they weren't around us most of the night. I am pretty  drunk by the end of the night, and Gretchen's best friend Lola decided to ditch her young friends and join the partying college kids. Lola and I hit it off, and we are talking for a long period of time. She shows me her tattoo, we talk about how hard it is to find jeans that fit properly (we are both quite tall), the whole bit. I wake up the next morning and Lola is gone, and I was kinda disappointed. \\n\\nI get a text from Gretchen saying that Lola wants my number, she was just too nervous to ask for it the night before. I oblige, and we start texting. She starts getting very serious about things and wants to hang out really bad and asks how serious we are and where this is going (which I am fine with, and I find very attractive actually)I am then informed that she is only 16 years old, and I realize that a relationship isn't going to work if I have to go back for spring semester in a week. And even after that, she's still in another year of high school. So I tell her that unfortunately I can't do the long distance thing, especially from college to high school. We are at different points in our lives and have different priorities. She is extremely understanding, and very cool about it. Then a few weeks later, she texts me and asks to hang out one weekend that I'm home. I politely decline and say something would happen between us, and then I would have to leave again for school and it would be too hard. She says, and I quote,\\n\\n \"pantherlax56 I'm not trying to start a relationship, I just want to hang out with you.\"\\n\\nI again politely decline the offer. She texts me intermittently after that, and I say maybe we can get together over the summer when I'm home for while. She says that sounds good. The texting pretty much cuts off a few days later.\\n\\nFast forward to the summer. Im home from school, and I'm ready to party with my friends I haven't seen in awhile. So my other friend, Richard, invites me over to his house for some beers. We watch F1 qualifying, and start talking about girls. As it happens, Richard and Lola are good friends. He tells me that she has been talking about me non stop, and he repeatedly told her \\n\\n\"you guys will be a thing over the summer just wait\"\\n\\n because he couldn't deal with her constant mentions of me. We're both pretty drunk, and he says, \\n\\n\"hey dude, its Lola's birthday today. If you wanna make someone's day, text her.\"\\n\\n So I do. We pretty much pick up right where we left off and things start getting hot and heavy pretty quick. We start making sexual innuendos on a daily basis, talking about \"studying extra hard\" for her finals and making sure she's \"extra prepared\" for her male reproductive system test (she's in nursing classes). I think to myself: \\n\\n1. I expressed my feelings about a relationship awhile ago, and she understood\\n2. She told me she didn't want a relationship either, just to hang out\\n3. We are talking very sexually within days of talking to each other for the first time in months\\n\\nAnd I conclude that we both want a casual hookup FWB type thing. So I ask to hang out, she says sure. I ask if we can hang out at her place, she says there is \"nowhere to go\" (furthering my assumptions of a casual sex thing). So I say she can come over to my house and we can \"study.\" She says sounds great. She comes over, we have sex, she goes home. I get a text from Lola that says, \\n\\n\"so what does this mean?\" \\n\\nand I ask, \\n\\n\"what do you mean, what does this mean?\"\\n\\n\"are we casual or is this going anywhere?\" she asks.\\n\\nI explain that I made an assumption based on what I thought were obvious clues, and I apologize, but my feelings about having a relationship with someone far away and still in high school haven't changed in 2 months. I apologize profusely, and reiterate the fact that we already talked about not being in a relationship and just hanging out. I thought I knew what that meant, but I was wrong. She gets very upset, and doesn't talk to me.\\n\\nI have now come to find out that Lola explained (in graphic detail) what her and I did to Jeremy and Gretchen's parents. My best friend's mother apparently said that I \"hit it and quit it.\" So the next time I was over at Jeremy's, it was terribly awkward because Lola, Gretchen, and Jeremy's parents were all there. Everyone knew that we had sex, and then just quit talking. \\n\\nLola hates me, Gretchen thinks I'm a \"fuckboi\", and her parents think I intentionally \"hit it and quit it.\"\\n\\nAm I an asshole for assuming what I did?\\n\\nEDIT: I left  a few things out of the original story in the interest of keeping it short. When we met, I was 18, she was 16. When we had sex, we were both a year older (19 and 17 respectively). I didn't just cease communication with her as soon as I pulled out, as some seem to think. I simply meant that it was very awkward between us due to the miscommunication, and she made it clear that she didn't want anything to do with me anymore. \\n\\nAlso, if I could defend myself a bit: Sex is an act that involves at least two people. If she didn't want to, she could have said/let on that she wasn't into it. But I know that she wanted to, because she initiated it physically. I won't get into the gory details but she definitely started and continued to enable the act of foreplay/intercourse. This was also the first time we hung out in person, just the two of us. I don't know about you all, but if I plan on starting a relationship with someone, I probably wouldn't have sex with them on the first \"date\" or whatever you might call our little hangout mesh.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I would like to clarify that 16 is the age of consent in my state. Regardless of your moral standings, I am in the clear legally. Also remember that she was 17, only 2 years younger than me at the time.   \n",

                                 So, I've been speaking to this girl from my college course for about two weeks we never really talked much before. We have been constantly on the phone with each other and we really hit it off. We both talked about the future and our past etc. She seemed really into me at first and we were planning on going out on a date. She then backed off because I am younger than her. The thing is I'm only under a year younger than her, I'm 17 she's 18. Last Friday a group of us went out to celebrate finishing our college course. She was being extremely flirty with one of my friends. Long story short they both kissed and it felt like a massive kick to the balls. Am I an asshole for being mad at her? I think the reason why I'm mad/upset with her is that she knew I really liked her. I'm also mad at my friend because he knew I liked her.    \n",

                 I'm 19, my sister is 32.\\n\\nMy parent gave my car to me at the start of my Senior year of high school as my early graduation present. This was so that I could get myself to school and the like. \\n\\nFinished high school since then, and I'm taking over gas and other fees for the vehicle once I get my first job (if all goes well, I should start early next month). My older sister does not have her own vehicle because she totaled the one(s) my parents bought her.\\n\\nThis year my parents begged me to let my sister borrow my car for work and driving her kids to school. I obliged because I didn't have a job at that point, so I didn't need the car every day. What harm could there be in it? \\n\\nWell, she ends up keeping the car for almost three months. Her husband had been driving it without permission and without a license. He was buying drugs in my car. My dad caught him and promptly took the car. \\n\\nWhen I finally got it back, it was absolutely trashed. I used to clean used cars, and I've never seen such a disgusting interior. I cleaned out enough trash to fill three 30-gallon trash bags. Piles and piles of food and soda cans. Plates with ranch dressing and pizza rolls just sitting on the seats. Food stains covering all my seats, which were almost spotless before. And my car had at least 5 cockroaches living inside. It took hours to clean.\\n\\nI don't understand how she could be so selfish. She showed no respect for a person who was allowing her to use their most expensive object. \\n\\nMy parents, who bend over backwards to make my sister happy, recently asked me to lend my car to her again for a few days. Because she wants to take her kids to Sunday school. I outright said no. \\n\\nI don't feel badly for my sister's sake, I feel badly because I told my parents no and they're the ones who purchased the car. Am I an asshole for that?   \n",

    So, I'm 19 and still live with my parents. I have a part time job averaging about 25 hours a week at minimum wage. My parents will ask me occassionally(as im sure all parents do) to pick up milk or some groceries from the store. I don't mind the chore, I like getting out and driving and walking around. However, what I do mind, is when I give them the receipt from my trip, which contains all THEY wanted(if I get anything for me, I do it on a seperate transaction as to not add confusion to the bill). Then, when I ask to be paid for it, my mother gets up in arms over asking for my money back. She uses arguments like, \"Oh well, I buy you things when im at the store and I don't ask you to pay me\" or \"When I was your age, Id buy my moms stuff because I loved my mommy so much.\", which to me doesn't make sense seeming how I pick up what I need or ask if they want me to pay them for any groceries I put on the list. The thing is, I wouldn't mind if these were just snide comments, but these turn into days long arguments over something like $11. Another factor that may play in is after my grandfather died, he left me a substantial amount of money to help pay for college, which my mother believes she was cheated out of. I already have lent her about $500 with her not paying that back yet, arguing that it shouldve been hers anyway. I feel I should mention my mom is on disability and my dad works full time. I guess, I want my money back, because I know if I don't ask in the moment, my mothers going to think that everytime she sends me to the store that Ill just cover it and end up making my lists so much longer and more expensive since I \"have the money to afford it anyway.\" What do you think here?\\n\\nTL:DR- I want my money back from either lending it to my mom or going on errands, while she believes that shes entitled to them as \"gifts\" or something.   \n",

Me and Chris have been friends for 6years, I'm 19 right now. We originally met in school when we were 13-14 years old. Back then like most boys, we did nothing but play a lot of videogames. We weren't your stereotypical Urkle-type nerd, but more the quiet bunch that played a lot of games and got along with nearly everyone. \\n\\nChris and me were part of a bigger group of 'core' friends. But since Chris and me had been classmates we knew eachother very well. I considered him one of my best friends.\\n\\nBack then I was out of shape aswell, needless to say me and Chris were really good friends and not the most popular in the school. As a kid with low confidence going through puberty, I 'dealt' with normal adolescent insecurities by being the nice guy. ( ~~sometimes to a fault when i look back at things~~ , definitely to a fault, I would let other people push me around )\\n\\n\\nDuring the next two years in school, I, then Chris respectivelly flunked a year in school. Because of this we ended up in different classes, and made different friends. I mostly hung out with my 'core' group, Chris more and more with a new group of friends. We were 16 at the time, still very good friends but hanging out less because of different friend groups. Soon after Chris made his new friends, he became attractive and popular. ( And more dickisch in my opinion )\\n\\nChris would never have time to hang out with me or any other friends from the original 'core' group anymore, since making new friends. This didn't bother me too much, people made new friends all the time during adolescence. \\n\\nI only started getting annoyed with Chris not having the time to hang out with me, when 2-3times a month he would show up to my place after school to drop of his stuff, so he wouldn't have to lugg it around when hanging out with his friends. I voiced once that I didn't like it that he would use my house as his personal locker, but let myself get pushed over since i was too timid and friendly. This went on untill we were about 18. \\n\\n\\nWhen we bothe started uni, Chris said he would have more time to hang out with his old friends now, since he wouldn't be able to see most of his then current friends. ( This always felt a bit fake to me, since it felt to me like our 'core' group got labelled as a plan B, for when plan A wasn't available )\\n\\nNow I'm a different person compared to when I was 13-16. I started lifting weights, grew till I was 1.88/6\"2, My 'face' had become attractive aswell. I started kickboxing aswell. All these things grew me a lot of confidence.\\n\\nThe straw that tipped the bucket... So me and some friends of the old 'core' group were hanging out at a quiet field with a nice view. Chris showed up aswell. ( Occasionally we'd meet when going out drinking/partying in town ). \\n\\n\\nWe sat in a cirkle and I was seated next to Chris. Chris started smoking and because of the direction of the wind, his smoke ended up in my face all the time. I stated this and asked him to either move, or stop smoking. He kinda ignored me and continued anyway. I sat in the grass for another 8ish seconds not really knowing how to make him stop since he wouldn't listen to me. So i pushed him. (We were bothe sitting in the grass next to eachother, this was more a one-armed light shoulder push then a full rage sparta push). Chris just laughed this off, and continued smoking again, he said that the only reason he let the smoke get in my face was because i reacted to it. Even though I didn't feel like I should have had to deal with this shit, I kept my mouth shut for another 15ish seconds whilst Chris continued to keep smoking. My other friends (and I guess Chris aswell) didn't really notice how serious I was with being annoyed with having constant smoke in my face. Well, I bursted, I stood up, yelled at Chris, called him out for all his shit, took my bike and left while my other friends were trying to calm me down.\\n\\nI guess the reason I'm mad at Chris is because he never respected me once he became popular, He would use me as a friend for when he needed one. \\n\\nEven after I became known as the attractive guy in my auditorium, he still wouldn't respect me. I always felt like he looked down on me as a friend. The worst part of this might be that I'm a confident guy, but I feel like a turn into a bitch whenever i stand across from Chris. Like I don't really care what people think off me, or wheter they 'respect' me or not. But for some reason I do with Chris, and I can't get over it. I feel like an idiot just being able to get so mad and even typing a whole story like this over something that is so trivial in my life. \\n\\nSo... Am I the asshole for yelling at Chris (because I guess i'm insecure when it comes to him) or is Chris the Asshole.\\n \\nTLDR: used to be an quiet, friendly, low selfesteem type kid. Had a very good friend who turned popular, and I feel like he 'used' and pushed me around as a friend, without ever standing up to him because of my low self esteem. We sort of parted ways naturally through school. By now I had become confident and popular myself. Was hanging out with some people including that particular 'friend'. He blew smoke in my face and wouldn't stop. I felt disrespected too much, and called him out on his shit.\\n\\n   \n",

not scared of them and mainly line up with Americas laws. My step father has a gun safe in the house and today he told me that he put a gun on lay-by. I assumed he told my mum (even though she HATES guns, and the idea of having a gun in the house.) I said just half-hour ago \"oh so Jack got his gun on lay-by today, thats exciting\" she went off at him and now they are fighting, he locked her phone in the gun safe and has taken off, we do have to toddlers in the house but the gun rules here are so strict that you must have the gun, the bullets, the magazine all in a different safe and the only time you can bring it out is when you are taking it to the range, its not like he would be playing with it around the house anyway. \\nAmItheAsshole?\\n\\nTLDR; step father told me he got a gun, i thought mum knew, she didn't, she hates guns, think they might have broken up   \n",

this girl for about a year, I actually met her when I was going to have a 3 way with my then fwb and her. I also had a friend that I've known for 15 years, and my father and his were best friends. Well, fast forward a couple years after I didn't have that 3 way because I ended up getting black out drunk at the college she went to and forgot about them, and she's engaged to my childhood friend, and she's pregnant. Now I'm a pretty liberal guy, and very open minded. She's very conservative. We're friends on Facebook and she posts shit saying Obama should be impeached and things like that, and I always like the cnn article of 182 things obama has done, and each one has citation. But then today she posted a picture saying something along the lines of marriage isn't about religion, or finances, and it's only about love. Then I posted something along the lines of saying it's wrong of her to sit there and say someone getting married because it's part of their religion, or making it a financial decision is wrong when she expects others to be tolerant of her views on it. She then proceeded to threaten me, and attack me personally. Which I ignored the personal attacks, and the threat because of my respect for my old friend. Then before I respond she tags him in it, and he calls me a douche for calling her on her shit. I responded by saying that I was happy for them (I'm not, she's a bitch and a slut) but that if she expects others to be open to her ideas about marriage she has to be open to others. She then threatened me again, and attacked me saying that my father didn't want me and I'm a failure. I don't talk to my dad by choice, and while I recently quit my job I have no debt, an she has student loans for a degree she didn't finish, and no job. I didn't say any of that though, nor did I post any of the pictures of her I have, nor did I tell him about the tumblr page she used to have that I got those pictures off of. What I did tell her is to thank him that I'm not going to flip out on her, and I blocked her. Then I messaged him saying I'm sorry things had to go down like that, and blocked him.\\n\\nPS I haven't talked to my dad in over a year and haven't seen him in about 2 and a half. He wasn't there growing up, and so me and this friend weren't best friends, but we were still friends.\\n\\nTL;DR Oldest friends slutty fiance doesn't like me, and we got into it. I ended up blocking her, and him, and lost my oldest friend. So am I the asshole?   \n",

 When I (28M) was dating my exgirlfriend (21F) I borrowed $90 from her. I then got dumped for my best mate and lied to for 8 months until a friend of hers told me. I offered to pay her back when we broke up and she said not to worry about it. We paid for each other's stuff all the time and consider it even. Three years later, last weekend, we were at the friends birthday and she tells me that I still owe her the money. Am I the asshole for not paying her back?    \n",

lived with her until I was 19.  When I moved out of her place she was upset that I wasn't going to college and instead moved in with my gf half a state away. Now I'm 22 and she is still pushing the college issue and trying to get me to move back with her. I feel like I should do what she says because in a way she saved my life, or at least made it what it is today, but I just really don't want to go to college or live in the town she is in. I feel like an asshole   \n",

                      I am 16, mixed Caucasian and Japanese, and working in a detail shop. My boss, who happened to be a close friend before he was my boss, likes to make Asian jokes every now and again. I don't really mind and play along most the time: \"Haha yeah keep talking and there won't be an iPhone 7!\"\\n\\nYesterday, we had this electrician guys come get us these sick lights in our new shop. It's like multiple mini suns suspended in the shop, beautiful. Anyway, he probably overhears my boss making Asian jokes and decides to put his own input in now and again.\\n\\n\"Do ya ever have trouble pronouncing his last name? Got a windchime in here when ya do? Ching chong!\" (My dad is white so I have a white last name)\\n\\n\"Do ya want me to find a white guy to work for ya? This Asian isn't even working hard! He ain't sweatin'!\"\\n\\n\"I can't read this. Can't your Asian read this Chinese on this here instruction manual?\"\\n\\nThere were many more. I had earplugs in and pretended not to hear any of this. AITA if I'm mad, even though in a way I brought it on myself?   \n",

lay it out for you Reddit, there is this girl in my class who (we'll call her Anna) asked for my number today in front of my entire group of friends. Now Anna is not particularly attractive, and she has come off fairly bitchy, (note - this is summer school so it is a new class) and is two years older than me (17 to 15). Not wanting to embarrass her, I write it down and give her my number. Now, what happens immediately is she begins flirting, asking me what I think of her, if I want to fix her bra, do I shave (down low) etc. Now this was very sudden, and I wasn't planning on going out with her, (she, again, came off bitchy in the two weeks we've been interacting) so I decided I'd rip the bandage off if she didn't chill out (I told her I wasn't overly comfortable taking about these subjects after just meeting her) so fast forward 2 hours of decent (flirty on her side) conversation, and I decided it was time. I told her I was not interested in having a relationship. (Never had one)\\nNow, she seems upset, and keeps asking to hangout, and I say no to, as it could lead her on, which is the opposite of what Im trying to do. \\n\\nSo tell me Reddit, i have literally no experience in this area, and I'm not sure if I handled this correctly, but am I the asshole?   \n",

at home. My mom passes by my room and I ask her to come in so we can talk about something. The something is purely benign, nothing important whatsoever, when she picks up a check written out to me, also benign in nature. She asks, \"What's this?\" in that slightly rushed cadence that implies at least a little suspicion. I maintain a cheerful demeanor and a humorous tone in telling her \"First, that's none of your business, but second, it's just a check from dad reimbursing me for textbooks.\" At hearing the \"none of your business\" she seemed shocked and said she didn't appreciate that. She's clearly upset but won't talk to me about what about the interaction is upsetting her even after I try to get her to talk about this situation. She doesn't think she overstepped any personal boundaries (I do), but she won't hear any of it. Anyways, the way she reacted makes me feel like I should feel guilty for saying what I did, but I feel completely justified in saying what I did, especially in the jovial manner that I did. So what do you think? Asshole or no asshole?   \n",

If anything is unclear please let me know and I'll try to clarify.\\n\\nI am 23 years old, recently graduated from college, and currently living with my mother on the East Coast (USA). If it matters my parents are divorced and I am not living under my father's roof. Recently my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together in California. This is a good move for me career-wise because I want to work in the biotech/pharma industry.\\n\\nI ask my father for advice frequently but he also gives a lot of unsolicited advice. He says that this is because he has an analytical problem-solving nature that he can't shut off. He  thinks that I need to have interviews lined up in CA before moving there, otherwise I will drain my savings.\\n\\nIdeally I'd love to have interviews lined up before moving but I personally don't think it's realistic. Companies often don't take applicants seriously if their address is on the other side of the country. I did apply to a lot of CA jobs during spring and never heard back from any of them. I was afraid that if I applied to more with my East Coast address it would be a waste. My father then suggested I put down an address of someone I know in CA, but I'd have to be able to fly down for interviews on short notice, which would also drain my savings.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I picked out a short-term lease apartment and he is willing to cover rent and other costs of living until I am employed. We made a budget. I have $8000 in savings that will be used on the security deposit and my plane ticket. The rest will be emergency funds. I do not expect my father to bail me out financially under any circumstances. I am not moving to CA for around a month, but I have started applying to jobs using the apartment's address. My father wanted me to have interviews lined up before choosing an apartment.\\n\\nI fully explained my reasoning to my father and I can explain more of my reasoning if anyone asks. I do understand my father's concerns and I know he's trying to look out for me. I told him that I took time to think on his advice but I am not going to follow it and I would like to stop discussing it. He got angry and told me that was a very disrespectful thing for me to say.\\n\\nMy father thinks I was just too lazy to apply for jobs early because people in my generation have lazy attitudes. He said he felt it was his duty to \"slap that attitude in the face\". I found this very hurtful because I'd applied to tons of East Coast jobs before deciding to move to CA, so I'm clearly not too lazy to apply to jobs. At this point both of us were raising our voices. \\n\\nAt 9:40 during the argument I told him I needed to leave soon to feed cats I was pet sitting by 10:00. He wouldn't drop the argument and I reminded him I needed to leave several times. The cats have special diets and need medicine, so by 10:40 I walked away from the argument, telling him I was already 40 minutes late to feed them. This is especially where I'm worried I was the asshole. But in my opinion it's definitely an asshole move to not feed the cats.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I told my father that when he gives me unsolicited advice I will always listen and consider it. But if I end up choosing not to follow his advice I want him to respect my decision. His response was that this is very disrespectful to him. I ended up walking out mid-argument because I was pet sitting cats with special dietary needs and was already 40 minutes late to feed them. My father was aware that I had this responsibility. I am 23, not living under my father's roof, and not depending on him financially. AITA for choosing not to follow his advice and/or leaving the argument to feed the cats?   \n",

                                                My Mum is all about veganism and organic living and all that. I'm 17 and so still live at home, I can't buy or eat anything she doesn't agree with or she'll flip out. I understand her whole thinking behind it all and in a perfect world it would be fine. But since she has 4 kids and is a single parent, she doesn't have the most income and often borrows money from us. Vegan and organic alternatives of things can cost 3 times the price of normal products. I have always felt that she's kind of selfish for saving to buy the 'right' food instead of just buying a cheaper option and having more money for other things.    \n",

                                                                 So im in high school (UK), ( year 9) and I like to go out locally with friends after it most nights, but my cousin who is three years older than me (16) started hanging out with us. He clearly makes my friends uncomfortable (although they didn't say anything). I also don't like the way they act in front of them. So the question is am i the asshole for going out with my friends and not invting him?   \n",

                                                       I'm 17 years old, and I like this girl who I go to school with, we talk often, but I just plain out suck at conversation, so I found another way to find things to say. One example is how I make alternate accounts on social media like Younow and things to ask questions about if she likes people, or what she thinks of certain things.\\n\\nI use that social media information as leverage in our conversations because now I have things to use when we talk. Does this make me an asshole, is it cheating a relationship in any way? Or is this what social media in intended for, I can't figure it out, but I feel awful.   \n",

                                                       To start off im 17 and in High School (Scotland) so im in my 6th year of highschool and some guy in my year group that i've known for 13 years (7 years in Primary, 6 in highschool) has started following my group of friends, how long i've known him is important because for all of that time, i have disliked him, for 11 years he was a total cunt to everyone, Bullying smaller people, people younger than him etc...\\n\\nSo he has started following me and my friends around in school because he is in the same class as one of them. We have told him to go away: Didn't work. We told him to fuck off: Didn't work. We've sat him down and had an actual conversation and asked him to go hang about with people that are actually his friends (Which he has) and his reply is usually something along the lines of \"It's a free country\" and thats his justification for following us around. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but as I said, he was a dick to everyone, so another reason I want him to leave us alone is the fact that people might think we are dicks for being \"Friends\" with him. It honestly ruins my school day some days just knowing that he's there, I listened to a recent JRE episode and he was talking about not letting people in his life that wont make it better and I agree with that as a rule of life. Because he hasn't left us alone, we have started telling him to fuck off, go hang about with your friends multiple times everyday (3-4 times)\\n\\nAre me and my friends assholes for being a dick to him because he wont leave us alone, is it bullying? I really don't feel like it is. Would appreciate feedback.   \n",

After some games for a while now me and one of my friends (who is probably in his mid 30s) have gone to subway or kfc because it is very close to the ground we play at. He has payed for me everytime we have gone. I thought that this was acceptable because I am not working and I do not get given an allowance by my parents, but my brother told me that this was not. Apparently I should be paying back for the food and offering to buy him drinks back at our cricket club. Am I the asshole?   \n",

My name is Cory, i'm 20 years old, and I currently live in a rough apartment complex. I have been living peacefully on the first floor for about two months until recently a single mother with three bad ass kids around the ages of six moved into the apartment directly above me. For approximately a week, the kids sound like they are intentionally trying to annoy the hell out of me by stomping around like apes. If you have ever had someone live above you, multiply the noise by ten and now you feel my pain. I have tried talking to the mother and explain to her how to control her kids, but that just seem to piss her off. Never tell a mother she is a bad parent, now it seems that it's non-stop play time for her kids. Little does she know I have a 1000W 5.1 surround sound system that I have not put to good use since the move to these apartments. A day later, I cranked up the music about midday, it made the water in my glass vibrate, so i'm sure she enjoyed the booming bass just as much as I. That went on for half an hour or so before I judged she had enough. For the rest of  the day I was able to read my Game of Thrones in silence, but to my disbelief, the next morning was hell. I could literally hear the mother tell her children to play football inside because it was too hot outside. Really bitch? I had to take it to the next level. The blasting of my music lasted for hours at a time during the day, I even gave her a taste of it around five in the morning. I can tell you she did not love that by the banging on my door about 20 minutes later. I told her I like to get pumped before my morning runs. She cursed and purposely stomped back upstairs to her zoo that she called home. Later that day I continued my music festival in my living room for about 2 more hours. It seems she has forfeited and began to settle her children down, but just to make sure I have continued the blasting of music just to put the nail in the coffin. Am I the Asshole?   \n",

                                       I am 17 and my friend is 15 and we spend almost everyday either working out or practicing our sport on our own. I have obtained my license while he is not yet old enough, and he expects me to pick him up and drop him off 90% of the time we go somewhere. He lives about 7  minutes in the opposite direction of where we typically go and I live a very short distance from the destination. AITA for usually making up excuses for why I cannot pick him up? Once I give him a reason for not being able to pick him up he normally gets a ride from his parents anyway! What should I be doing differently? I hate feeling like a damn taxi!   \n",

    Hey I'm 23 years old i have a friend that i have known since i was 4 years old (we shall call him Tim). So for most of the 19 years his family has taken me in treated me like there own, they have taken me on camping trips, hockey games, bought me a guitar so me and Tim could both learn to play. Tim and I were the best of friends but as time moved on we would be on again off again friends mainly cause i didnt like the way he treated me. This is the part I sould have started with lol, for many years Tim had to be the best at everything. He was very arrogant and cocky, he would bash you no matter what. so here is the problem O.k so i have been with the love of my life for now 5 years we are getting married in one week from this being posted. my \"best friend\" claims that my wedding is a big inconvenience to him because he is the best man and he has to throw a few little partys and shit like that other then that he has to just get ready and show up for the day of the wedding and that is all besides a speech. He claims I'm doing this to young and that I am ridiculous for even moving as \"fast\" as we are we have been together for 5 YEARS! Now I do understand that 5 years isn't that long but long enough for her and my self. After he and I had a talk one night about my wedding and I was saying how it sucked that all my money is currently being drained, this is when he said that i should move on leave my woman cause I'll be a no body unlike him who is going to be a somebody. I then turn to him and say, \"after my wedding we are done, I'm sick of you treating me like dirt walking all over me and I'm sick of you being a CUNT!\" then I walked off so AITA?   \n",

stepped out of the car to go in one of the buildings for a second and I was right next to a dumpster and opened my door to throw this bag I had away. This car pulls up to me and tells me to roll down the window and asks why the Fuck I'm throwing trash away in his dumpster and why I'm trespassing. I told him I was sorry and that I was just waiting for my mom and had a piece of trash. I said I wouldn't do it again. He then takes a picture of the license plate and says he will personally make sure the police have me, not my mom pay him a huge fine or serve jail time and drives away. Am I an asshole for that? and can I really get a fine or jail time for that? I'm 18.\\n   \n",

                    I'm going to make this as non-biased as possible.\\n\\nI'm 16.\\n\\nAround a month ago I bought some weed from a friend of mine. I payed ยฃ30 for it and brought it home. Within a day my mother smelled the substance and told me that I wasn't allowed to have it in her house because it's illegal. Fair enough. I took it out to the shed and put it there on her recommendation. A little while later whilst they were on holiday I took it down to a nearby city and smoked most of it with some friends who I met there.\\n\\nThis was whilst my family were on holiday.\\n\\nI came back and since I still had a little bit left I left it in my back and forgot about it. Sure enough, the morning after they came back my mother smelled it again. She asked if I still had the weed and without thinking I said no.\\n\\nA few days later I was searching through my bag and came across it. Rather than waiting for them to leave and putting it in the shed, I admitted that I had it and went to put it in the shed. She went ballistic.\\n\\nI was told about how disgusting it was that I was smoking it and how horrible I was for bringing it into her house again. I was threatened to have the police called on me all as I tried to defend myself by asking:\\n\\n\"How is having pot in the house going to affect anybody negatively. The fact that you've got a little bit of pot in your shed hardly eats away at your mind every minute of every day, does it?\"\\n\\nThis was greeted with more yelling, followed by her calling my father, who I don't have a very good relationship with anyway. He was passed on to me, again threatening to call the police on me. Again, I asked how calling the police would have any positive outcome on anybody. I was told that it'd teach me a lesson. \\n\\nAfter that I went up to my room, logged onto Reddit, and wrote this post.\\n\\nSo I implore you, am I the asshole?   \n",

audio equipment.  Since I'm a college student and don't have a ton of money, this means I frequent thrift stores and antique shops and the like, looking for cheap killer records/equipment from recent donations.\\n\\nThis particular Sunday, I was helping my sister move cities and I had to swing by her old place alone late-ish at night (maybe 7?) to pick up the last of her stuff.  Since she lives right near a thrift store and I'm never in this city, I decide to check it out.  I pull in to the parking lot... and it's closed on Sundays.  But I notice in the parking lot someone dropped off a big pile of shit (clothes, dishes etc.).  Curiosity gets the best of me and I walk up for a closer look.  Records.  TONS OF RECORDS.  So naturally I drive up, load up the truck, and drive off.\\n\\nOn one hand, this was simply someone's garbage that they wanted to get rid of and is technically considered 'on the side of the road'.  On the other, I may have diverted funds that would have otherwise went to charity, had they sorted and sold them the next day.\\n\\nSo am I an asshole?   \n",

important in this tale. I am a sophomore. My dog is a half dachshund, half chihuahua. Looks like a tiny wiener. Obvious questions are now out of the way.\\n\\nSo, my mom and dad are divorced. We go to their house every other weekend. I also have a dog. She usually stays with my mom during our visits.\\n\\nThis particular visit, it's labor day weekend. My mom is going to Hilton Head, but promised me weeks in advance that she would find a place for my dog while she was gone.\\n\\nNow, it's Friday, she tells me she never found a place for my dog, she forgot completely. She got very annoyed when I tried to back out of my dad's visit to watch my dog. \\n\\nShe said she'd put her somewhere safe. I asked if she could at least get a neighbor to check on my dog every day. No reply from her.\\n\\nSo we are halfway to his house now, my mom tells me she's just putting my dog in the garage. I tell her I don't want to visit my dad. She doesn't let me. \\n\\nI come home, my dog is in a 6x6 pen with her crate in one side, the other has two big things of food and water with a towel (for pee, I guess).\\n\\nI am pissed, appalled and upset all at once. There is indeed AC in the garage, but my dog has not touched her food or water the entire three days we are gone. I quickly take her for a walk, then take her stuff back to my room and give her food and water, which I have to coax her to eat. She is very scared and distant.\\n\\nMy mom isn't back until late Tuesday, but my brother is here. He also goes to school with me, so we'd essentially leave her home alone all day.\\n\\nI really did not feel right doing that. She is in no condition to be abandoned.\\n\\nI cut school.\\n\\nMy mom finds out, grounds me from my laptop. She says I should have brought my dog to my dad's, even though he only okayed it when we were halfway to his house. She would not let me go back to her, let alone go back 23 minutes to get her and then drive 40 minutes back to his place with a barking dog (she's scared of the car, my mom keeps her in the crate the whole way due to allergies).\\n\\nI've spent all day caring for my dog, and doing chores. My mom is still pissed, but I don't feel too bad. My dog was in a really bad place.\\n\\nIf I'm not descriptive on something, please tell me.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?    \n",

past.  Nothing serious ever, and no relationship has ever occured (i live in the southeast, she lives in the midwest, but we share similar rave friends... yes I rave get over it).  \\n\\nEverything was fine until this trip.  I arrive and she starts insulting me immediately.  Everytime we're around other people she's belittling me.  Then the second we get alone at the festival she apologizes and tells me she didn't want to hurt my feelings. \\n\\nSo we get two days in and another young lady is kind of into me and tells me she wants to share my bed.  We don't do anything physical but Girl #1 is really upset that we're even sleeping in the same room.  She takes a picture of us and texts it to me (creepy) and then tells me how i'm a jerk for \"sleeping\" with another woman.  We are not dating, and definitely are not in a relationship.  I'm a single man who has no other obligations currently.  Am I the asshole?  \\n\\n(as an aside, this was the last day of a three day festival she got angry.  And i feel like I gave her plenty of clues that she could have hooked up with me if she wanted during the timeframe)\\n\\nPre-Edit1:  I realize this sounds like i'm 18, but i'm a bit older.  So please have mercy on me in the comments. \\n\\nPre-Edit2: or whatever, fuck my inbox   \n",

attracted to the other. I tried to explain to her how I consider her sister my friend. I'm 32 years old and I've known her best friend since I was in the 7th grade. Her mom was friends with my aunt, and now that we're married I see her best friend often. I told her that I consider her BEST friend my friend, and she says to me that \"she's not your friend, she's your associate through me\", despite our history. I proceeded to hit her with this hypothetical that sparked a big argument;\\n\\n\"If your best friend was seeking shelter from a physically abusive boyfriend and had nowhere else to turn. She came knocking on the door, and you were out of town, I would let her in and I'd help her\" \\n\\nShe then goes off on me telling me how wrong I'd be for letting her in the house, and letting her sleep in the house while she's out of town. I never said that she could sleep over, but she jumped right to that. Now we're at each others neck over woman I knew from high school whom I consider to be my friends. She says we're not friends because we don't hang out and don't talk often. I'm trying to explain to her that it doesn't change the fact that I care about them in a friendly way. I don't know...I'm starting to think I'm an asshole just because she thinks I'm an asshole.    \n",

 After having lunch, we decided to have some ice cream for dessert. So my dad (who treats me like a little kid even though I'm 16) asks me and my sister, \"Okay, who wants ICE CREAM?\", and so I don't respond. Anyways, he serves my sister her ice cream, and when he goes to serve mine, I tell him, \"it's fine I want to scoop my own\" and he starts getting difficult telling me that he's going to serve me my ice cream. I keep telling him that I want him to let me do it, but eventually he just got so fed-up and put my cone scoop-down into the container while telling me, \"Don't be such an idiot\". So, am I the asshole?\\n\\nE: Just wanted to make it clear; I'm aware that the situation was stupid and childish. I'm pretty sure that the reason these stupid fights happen at my house is because my dad's a lawyer and will not accept the fact that he can be wrong sometimes.   \n",

             Sorry, this is probably really petty and stupid, but it's just something that's been building up all day. So, I'm 18, I still live with my mum at the moment, and she woke me up this morning and started frantically asking me what I wanted to eat for breakfast, something quick and cheap, like McDonalds, because my brother has to be somewhere soon and doesn't have the time to get real breakfast or anything like that.\\n\\nNow, it's not uncommon for my mum to write things down on random junk mail, so she's got this old bill and is staring at it intently and I ask her what it is, and she just tells me to ignore it and continue texting my brother what I want, so I do, but when she sees me put the phone aside, she starts freaking out asking me what I texted him, did I text him? Like, you just saw me do it, but sure yeah I texted him, I wanted breakfast. \"But breakfast isn't being served anymore, it's over.\" Makes me wonder why she asked what I wanted for breakfast, but I'm like, alright, and text him something else. I once again put the phone aside and she once again starts freaking out. \"Did you text him what I wanted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, sorry, I didn't know you wanted anything.\" I had assumed she'd wrote it down for him before he left.\\n\\nShe gestures to the bill she told me to ignore, her supposed order written down on it I think? I'm still not sure what she wanted me to understand about the envelope. \"He's probably already there! I don't want anything now!\" and then slams the door in my face. At this point I'm crying. I know, probably pretty lame to do, but it was one half due to frustration and the other half from being yelled at like that.\\n\\nShe's been pissed off at me all day. It's not uncommon for her to take her anger out on only me, seeing as how my brother also has anger issues and she's intimidated by him, so she goes for someone she knows won't fight back I guess. It's just been getting me really down all day, because I'm not sure what I did wrong to make her so mad at me like this.\\n\\nSo, I tentatively ask, am I the asshole?   \n",

and asked me for two dollars. I asked her what she needed it for and she said it was for the bus. I only had a 10 dollar bill at the time so I gave it to her. Five minutes later I saw her talking to someone else asking them for money. I watched take money from the guy and walk away. I followed her then she went up to a lady and started talking to her, then took a few dollars from her. So i was like wtf and walked up and confronted her. I told her I thought she had enough money for the bus and I wanted my 10 dollars back. She gave it back to me but she started to tear up. I was pretty pissed at the time so i didnt give a shit and walked away. Am i the asshole?   \n",

middle of September, I got an on campus work study job. I started working in the middle of a pay week so I only got about half of the pay that I would have expected, (The amount of money doesn't matter in this situation). So I set up my direct deposit having 65% going into my debit card, and 35% going into a savings account for books and other school stuff next semester. For some reason, the payroll office canceled my savings account before my first paycheck. No big deal really, I just got about $45 in my debit card and the rest came as a check in the mail a couple days later. So here's where the annoying shit starts to happen. \\n\\nThe day before I get payed the second time, a pay stub goes out online. When I got home I went to see how much money I was supposed to get and when I checked, it said my money was going into a credit card at a bank which I don't have an account with. My first though is that someone is committing fraud and it trying to take my money. This was at around 7 o'clock, so the bank and the payroll office were both closed and I went to bed pissed off. The next morning (Friday), I called the payroll office and what they told me is that my account number was denied and that the credit card my money was on was a student account that was made for me (I was never told about this until then). So I set up my direct deposit again and the lady on the phone told me that the two account numbers were different (Being the one before it got declined and the one i just entered) I checked what I just put in and it was correct. After I got off the phone, I called my bank and got on the phone with an extremely rude women who kept interrupting me and telling me I wasn't making sense. I was told to call back on Monday. Today is Wednesday. I got my other card with my money on it (thank god) and my direct deposit is good to go. However, I just got another email from the payroll office telling me AGAIN that the reason they canceled my information, was because my account number was wrong. I'm sorry if I didn't explain it before because i'm ranting, but the problem I have is, why did I get paid on my debit card the first week if my information was invalid? I was stuck between whether or not the payroll office or the bank messed up. I am leaning towards the fact that the payroll office messed up and just canceled my information for some stupid reason, causing all of these problems. I have been getting countless emails about it and I'm starting to get sick of it. I am about to call them and complain because it is absolutely ridiculous. Am I the asshole for wanting to call them back because they have been messing with my shit?\\n\\ntl;dr Am I the asshole for wanting to complain to my payroll office for fucking up my pay. \\n\\n\\nEdit: Ended up not calling. Figured I would just let it go cause there's not use in getting mad when it's all over.   \n",

parents roof and in with 2 of my absolute best friends. I've come to the realization that I was raised very differently then them when it comes to family. They (Kelly and Austin) we're raised in big family oriented households and so every friend that they had in their lives met the whole of their respective families fairly soon. I however was not raised in such a family oriented way, I never had any friends meet my family unless it was absolutely necessary (going out of town, having a sleepover or what have you, things that required a parent or guardian to be aware of what was happening). Anyway a few weeks ago somehow meeting my now, Kelly and Austin have still never met my family but about a week ago it got brought up and I said I didn't want them to meet because it wasn't necessary. That's not to say they have no way to contact my family, I've given my friends my parents' phone numbers in case of an emergency and vice versa they want to meet and be incorporated into my family. I have met and get along famously with both of their families but then it wasn't really my choice to meet them it was just sort of a last minute thing. I don't really have any reasons for my friends to not meet my family other than it's not necessary or that the parties involved wouldn't mesh like I do with my friends it would be more like saying hello to someone in an office, nothing really there just a social obligation to be nice. Just curious if I'm in the wrong here.   \n",

about 4 month now. A few weeks before we started dating, her father got diagnosed with cancer and she told me that only a month ago and refused to talk about the hole situation with me. 2 weeks ago, she called me in the evening, cried and said that her dad just passed away. so I wanted to come over and hold her, but she told me to stay away and the idiot I was, I stayed home. now she refuses to talk with me about everything again (or even meet me), but I was fine with that, because I thought she might need time with herself and her family now...\\nbut yesterday I discovered that her dad died a hole day before she called me. and on that day/night she called two of her male friends who came over to her in the middle of the night. and the real reason why she didn't meet me, was that she hung up with them a hole lot lately. so I confronted her with that today...\\nfirst she only was curious about how I found that out and then she told me \"that I am just not the right person she needs right now\"!\\nso... Am I the asshole fir braking up with her directly after that?   \n",

Today my parents came home from the store at about 4 PM, and told me that they are going out to eat tonight and have food made for us, I said okay and was fine with them going out, because they deserve it. Then my sister starts complaining to my mother that she doesn't have anything to do tonight and she wants to go to the movies with her friends, but everyone is busy. So while we are trying to figure out what my little sister should do, my dad suggests \"What if I went up and got a movie and you guys played games?\" At this point I kind of look at him like... seriously? Now I have to entertain my sister? And he goes \"What? Is there something wrong with that?\" And I say \"No, she's 11, she has a computer and TV in her room and she can entertain herself for 2 hours. Why do I have to entertain her with games?\" Then my mother comes in and says \"Fine we are just gonna stay here and eat with you, it's too stressful to go out.\"\\n\\n\\nSo now, because of my 11 year old little sister, with a computer and TV in her room, can't entertain herself for 2 hours, my parents can't go out and spend their well deserved time together, and now apparently I'm the asshole. Great.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I'm the asshole. I went out and played games with my little sister for about 2 hours, had a fun time. Parents ended up going out and I apologized to everyone. Hopefully I can fix everything. Thanks guys and girls.   \n",

of my best friends Juicy (27M) and I often buy weed together. Juicy sometimes finishes faster than I do and then buys the rest off me. this has happened 2-4 times, we're unsure exactly. Just now, Juicy asked if he could buy the rest off of me and I told him I'd only sell it to him this one time for a small premium.\\n\\nMy reason for doing it is because I feel like I turn my money into inventory because I want to have that inventory. I should be rewarded (this one time) for the service of often buying inventory and being the guy that he, and others, can fall back on in a time of need. I don't see the point of buying weed and selling it to my friends for what I bought it for.\\n\\nHe is upset because he says that I'm making extra money off of him and feels that is a move that best friends shouldn't do.\\n\\nI see both sides, but need to know who the asshole is...   \n",

Let's say my name is Josh. Make it easy. I'm 16 for reference and a junior in high school.\\n\\nSo this happened tonight. I texted my friend - let's call him Nate - asking if he wanted to hang out. Sure, and he proposes that we go hang out with my ex - who we'll call Abby - and her friend - Jane works. I said \"No\" because I knew it would be awkward for pretty much everyone. Nate and I agree we'll hang out at my house for a bit, and then figure out something to do.\\n\\nI go and pick him up from his house, and as we're driving back to my house, Abby calls him and says she and Jane are buying ice cream from dairy queen and asks if we want any. Nate immediately says \"I'll have a Reese's and Josh will have a chocolate.\" He didn't actually ask me. I tell him I don't want anything. He offers to pay, and it's not worth arguing, so I turn around and start driving to Dairy Queen.\\n\\nWell, they were actually 45 minutes away at a different dairy queen. I drive there, just to not leave them there.\\n\\nWhen we get there, Nate bails, and says he was kidding about paying for me. I pay up, but he knows I'm starting to get annoyed.\\n\\nWe then go into a Target to kill time. It was awkward. Very awkward. Abby and I didn't really talk and it was a lot of silence. I didn't have a good time, and I told Nate, \"I wanna just go hang out with some other friends or at least go back to my house. This isn't fun at all for me. It sucks.\" He says \"Okay, we'll go to your house once we leave.\"\\n\\n15 minutes later as were walking out, Nate gets the idea in everyone's heads we should go play laser tag. I groan and give him an evil eye. \"It'll be fun. I promise it'll be quick.\"\\n\\nWe go to this place - I'll just call it the arcade - that has bowling, arcade games, laser tag, a ropes course, and an assortment of other things. We agree to just play a quick game of laser tag before hand. When we walk in, Jane says we should buy the unlimited pass and do a bunch of stuff. The unlimited pass is $25. They all now want to buy the unlimited pass, and Nate is trying to convince me to pay for Abby, and he'll pay for Jane. I say no, and convince them to just do the one laser tag game. I go up and buy my ticket first. The three of them... go up and buy unlimited passes even though they said they'd do just the laser tag game.\\n\\nWe all go to the laser tag first. \"We'll play laser tag first and then just a few games.\"\\n\\nAs we get right to the front, they see the ropes course, and run off and abandon me, which happened to be the time the door opened to the laser tag. I was first in line, and ushered in by the moving line. I end up playing laser tag by myself and then sitting there at the entrance for half an hour cause I couldn't find them (the place is BIG) and they wouldn't answer they're phones.\\n\\nWhen they do come back, I glare at them, and Nate utters a quick \"sorry\". As were walking out an hour later, we're thinking of something else to do. It's now been four hours. Nate wants to go hang out with some people in theater, since the show just got out. This is where I draw the line. Hanging out with Abby was uncomfortable. Hanging out with the people he wants to hang out with sucks. I hate them and they hate me. It'd be terrible. I tell them, that this night has been awkward and been mostly bad already. I'm not going to hang out with that group and make it worse. I say \"Either, we can go hang out with Simon and Bob (my two best friends), go hang out at my place, or I'm going home. You can find your own way home, or I'll drop you off on the way back.\" He starts arguing and telling me \"It'll be fun.\" I finally just say \"You know what, go with Abby and Jane. I'm leaving\". \\n\\nThey knew the whole night that I was not having a good time, and pretty angry that I was getting stepped on.\\n\\nSo I get in my car and drive home, leaving Nate to get driven around by Abby. This was at 9.\\n\\nAt 11:30, I get a call from Abby saying she got pulled over, and got a ticket for having too many people in her car (she just got her license and can only have one person in the car with her). She blames me since I left her with Nate. But, she had also picked up another person, and it's been 2 and half hours since I left. Now Nate, Abby, and Jane all are calling me an asshole for causing Abby to get a ticket.\\n\\n\\nSo am an asshole for leaving my friend after a crappy night for me, and then being a part of the reason she got a ticket?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                         So a couple nights ago I was asked to help a friend's wife (friends with her too, but making the distinction for later) run reception and registration for a public event. It's supposed to be practice for building up my public speaking/interaction skills.\\n\\nAnyhow, I ended up hesitating at nearly every opportunity to do my job, especially after I made a major fuck-up in charging a speaker's guests for parking. If I waited just a split second, my friend's wife would jump in and do it. So she ended up doing just about everything.\\n\\nAfter we'd finished the main part of the job, I mentioned to her that I wished I had done more. And she sort of told me \"Well that's the job, just smiling and letting people in. You hate it, right?\" I didn't really, I just felt like a fucking cunt. So I rephrased what I'd just said, and she told me that she didn't need my help if I hated it. I don't argue unless I'm absolutely being fucked over, so I just agreed and shut up.\\n\\nThen she sent me downstairs with my friend (the husband) to spend the rest of the event. Yesterday he messages me over Facebook and tells me that he'd prefer that I act like a grownup (I mean I'm 20, so partially there at least, and from a shitass household &amp; social situation that constantly insulted me my entire childhood, I've told him this) and stop whining and complaining when he sends me to help with stuff, especially involving his wife. I tested the waters, stating that I'd like the job better described to me beforehand next time. He says that I should just shut up and take advice like a grownup (btw literally the word he used) and do better next time. Once again I just shut up, because pitting myself against a wife never ends well.\\n\\nI will admit I complain probably significantly more than other people, it's one of the few ways I get relief from stress, if a shitty one. It's half the reason for this post. And I know this quibble is going to become a problem from here on if one of us doesn't address it (and guess what social incompetent me is worst at?).

We hooked up quick, we only knew each other a few weeks before we got together. Well I've been happy at times with her, but i never really get \"that\" connection. What makes it worse, is i believe this relationship is turning toxic. Shes been really obsessive lately. To the point of calling me 76 times last night while i slept(im a heavy sleeper lol). And also telling me she wants a kid, multiple times. So I've been thinking about ending the relationship, but i dont want to be an asshole. K thanx bye.   \n",

                                       My dad told me on my birthday he was going to send me money. My birthday was in September. He called me Monday night and said \"Hey lex, I'm going to be giving you the money on Friday.\" Friday rolls around. \"I'll do it tomorrow at 12.\" My dad lives in Philly and I live in California. It's 10:39 right now so in Philly it's 1:39. I really need to give my mom $20 so she can finish off her bills and I also need to get gifts for everyone but the only day my mom will take me to the store is today. (I'm 17, what you gonna do ยฏ\\_(ใ)_/ยฏ) \\nI texted my dad saying \"Hey, I don't mean to rush you but are you still going to send the money?\" Was that rude? Am I being an asshole for asking him for my money?\\nIt's only $150 but when you don't have a job and it's a miracle when your mom hands you $10, you get pretty ecstatic over it.\\n   \n",

I don't want to watch it because it's almost certainly going to be a trigger for me because my brother was violently abusive, physically and emotionally, and the newest movie will bring all of this back up for me (explained in the description) when I've been trying so hard to move on. I've told him several times to take one of his friends so that they both have a good time but he thinks I should just come because it's only for a \"couple of hours every two years\". Should I suck it up and go or refuse?\\n\\nFirst: There's a reason why I'm not posting this in /r/relationships. They're paranoid and jump to conclusions and they demand everybody break up over the smallest thing. So please, no comments about my relationship because my partner has always been 110% respectful and loving. I'd just like an opinion about this one thing.\\n\\nMy partner loves Star Wars passionately. For weeks he has been asking me to watch the new movie with him and literally every single time he has asked me, I have told him that I don't like Star Wars (I can definitely understand why others do but the terrible acting and retcon distract me from enjoying it) and that I want him to take one of his friends (who all love it) because they'll enjoy it more. He gets hurt and says he wants to share his excitement for it with me.\\n\\nHere's the thing. My (26) brother was very, very abusive towards me for the first nineteen years of my life (I'm now 23). He regularly beat me, pulled knives on me (my childhood bedroom door had stab holes in it because he came at me with a cleaver and I only just got it shut and locked in time), spread rumors about me at school so I wouldn't have friends, screamed at me, encouraged me to self harm and commit suicide, and destroyed my prized possesions. All of this while crying loudly. For nineteen years, this happened literally about three times a week. I am not exaggerating any of this. He did the same to my mother and even blamed her cancer death on me (go figure). He is crazy and delusional and I have cut him out of my life. He is not mentally disabled, but I assume he has an undiagnosed mental illness.\\n\\nI'm still fucked up from this. I'm doing my best to move on but some things scare the shit out of me (I'm very resistant to using the word \"trigger\" because of how Reddit gets angry at anyone who says it but that's pretty much what it is) like if someone gets angry and screams suddenly, if I see a child throwing a tantrum, and if I'm forced to be around things that my brother destroyed. Star Wars comes into this because he destroyed all of our Star Wars toys in a fit of rage while screaming at me and trying to hit me. I can handle myself fine with seeing Star Wars merchandise and references and posters and stuff of course, but being trapped in a stuffy dark cinema for several hours being forced to watch that movie is different and will fuck me up. **He knows the reason why I don't want to watch it. I finally told him the true reason last night (after weeks of saying i didn't want to watch it because i hate the franchise) and since then he's been very distant and hurt but still says he wants me to watch it since it's only a few hours.**\\n\\nHe's upset and keeps going on about how he just wants to share something he loves with me. He doesn't want to go with a friend because he lost contact with them when he started a new job a couple of months ago that means he doesn't have much spare time. I know for a fact his friends would love to go with him and he would absolutely have the time if he didn't see me for one weekend.\\n\\nI know he loves me and is genuinely sad that I'm so resistant to enjoying something with him. I also know how weak and pathetic I  am by not being able to suck it up and go watch it. In my defence I only got away from my abusive brother in 2012, after nineteen straight years of him attacking me three times a week and it's going to take me longer than three fucking years to be completely okay after something like that.\\n\\nI'm thinking of the following options: \\n\\na) I email him more details about exactly what my brother did to me, because at the moment my partner just does not seem to get it even though he knows the overall story, and hope he realises just how badly this will hurt me. I'm worried this will be guilt tripping though.\\n\\nb) I harden the fuck up and go and not complain. This will essentially be bottling my emotions up though and he and I have always sworn to have a communicative relationship.   \n",

                    So first things first, I am 21, working full time in a bank and have been since I was 18. Due to this I am moved out, have a fair bit of savings (Not a massive amount) and a car (Agian nothing great only about 8k but I payed for it)\\n\\nNone of my old high school friends worked straight of school, most of them did nothing for a few years and have only recently started working, a few months back one of my friends asked to borrow 6k in order to buy a car (He currently had one financed, but he had 20k owning on a 16k car) he told me he intended to use the 6k I would borrow him to buy a new car, then he would sell his current car, pay me back and then put the rest off of the finance, and he would be in a much better financial situation then he was, all within the space of roughly 30 days.\\nI was very hesitant about it but I lent him the money and let it go for about a week.\\n\\nAs I ask him how selling the car is going he tells me, his sister is going to pay for the car, but due to her only being 18, she cannot afford to just outright pay the 15k he would have wanted, so instead she would make the payments on the car instead, but it would stay in his name. After a bit of a discussion over how dumb that was, he told me that he would not be able to pay me my 6k back, but he would instead send me $200 every fortnight until it was repayed, so rather then me getting my money back within 30 days, I am facing the realization of not being fully repayed for 30 fortnights (13 months).\\n\\nSo REDDIT, would I be the arse hole for asking him for my 6k by the end of January, with some sort of ultimatum, or should I just let it slide, knowing that maybe he can not afford the 6k and can not get the money off of anyone else.\\n\\nP.S\\nI have lent him 2k in the past to buy a new computer, which he payed me for within two months.\\n\\nP.P.S\\nMy savings was growing rather high, and I had began talking to people about either investing in stock or getting into the property game, and thought the month wait would not matter, but not I completely regret this decision.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nI lent a friend $6000 who said he would repay it within a month, after spending the money, he tells me that he can only afford to repay me $200 a fortnight until it is repayed   \n",

                                            I'm using a throwaway for various reasons. So, with a little bit of backstory, I'm from the UK, am 17, am an only child and currently live with my parents. My parents tend to go out a lot of the time and sometimes leave me alone frequently. They leave me things to cook for myself if they're not going to be there the whole day/night. However, most of the time I have to cook myself something (usually rice and fish fingers or something like that) and resort to snacking alot as a result of not having much food in the house.\\n\\nSo today I've been at home with my Dad doing some school work and playing some games while my Mum's been out the whole day with one of her friends. This evening my dad's gone out to the pub and to a restaurant with his friends while my mum has gone out with her friends too. They also went out last night to a friends house and I had to make something for myself as usual. I was a little mad at them and told my Dad that I wanted a fully cooked meal but he told me to just have leftover food from Christmas. I asked him if we could go to Mcdonalds or something because it would have at least filled me up. He told me he would only go to get one if I paid for it.\\n\\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for getting mad at my parents that they won't pay for me to have takeaway food or at least make me something themselves? I'm not really sure if I'm overreacting at all or they're genuinely in the wrong.    \n",

    Just a little backstory, I'm 15 and had a brother since I was 4, and he's been mean to me pretty much all his life. People always say to me \"Oh, he's your brother, you're gonna appreciate him in the future.\" But it's not like that, when he was younger my dad was over seas, and after that my parents got divorced. We've mostly been with our mom ever since, we go to our dads about 1 day a week. And he's learned my mom's flaws in parents (ex: doing something to her if she won't get him something.) And when he's with my mom he's always mean to her. But when he's with my dad he's always well behaved. Enough with the relationships with my parents, let's talk about our relationships. I've always tried to be nice to him, like giving advice for school or playing a game with him. But he's always mean to me, I always have to live in fear that he will break all my things, yet I won't break any of his things. Even when he gets in fights with my mom he always takes one of my things, or maybe break it. I don't want to hurt him, but somethings I have too (The only times I've hurt him if he's hurting my mom.) He's always disrespectful to people my mom is dating, or friends with. Sometimes he's even the reason the person dumped her. I could go on for awhile about what he's done to me and other people, but I can't think of a time that he's been nice to me.\\n\\nWell I just wanted to figure out if I'm the asshole for not wanting him, in some cases wanting him dead.   \n",

Tonight, I went out with 4 friends of mine. 3 of which I have known for years - one of which I have known for months, only meeting him about 3 times, but have come to become good friends with him. Let's  call him Bill. Anyways, Bill does \"graffiti\". By this, I mean he writes the word ,\"Anarchy\" or someshit in some stupid messy handwriting. There is nothing artistic about it. \\n\\n\\nAnyways, to cut a long story short, I was invited to a New Years Eve party where I only knew 4 people out of about 70. 2 of these 4 people, I hadn't seen in years, and only knew them through primary school. My other 4 friends, including Bill, knew nobody. I knew that Bill had spray paint and markers on him, and to be honest, I couldn't care less if he graffitied some random public property. Bill asked me at some point throughout the night if he should tag the house. I told him no. That was a stupid idea. He agreed. \\n\\n\\nHours later, I had left the party and was on the other side of the road of the house at a park with a girl I had met. We heard very loud, angry shouting, and the host kept calling the girl I was with, asking where she was and that she had to talk to her urgently. I thought nothing of it, as it was already 1am, and new years was over. I thought it was a fight between a few blokes and the rest of the party came out to watch them punchon, as we could see that the entire party had emptied onto the street. \\n\\n\\nMe and the girl hurried back, and as I walked back to the party, I could hear people talking about graffiti and tagging and how someone had tagged a bunch of cars.. Turns out my mate, Bill, had stupidly decided to SPRAY PAINT his stupid tag on the inside of the house and tag a bunch of cars, including the owner of the house and their uncle's car, outside with his whiteboard marker (luckily this was able to be removed easily).\\n\\nI walk back inside the house to get my bag, and as I try to leave, the bouncers, parents and brother and sister (hosts) of the party confront me. The bouncers intimidate me, saying they know that I know who did it. They say they want his name and to don't fuck around because if i lie, they will call the police and find out the truth the hard way. At this point, i am shaking because I had no idea how serious this was, but was starting to realise.\\n\\n\\nThe entire party had been kicked out and forced to go home. I reluctantly (I didn't want to see Bill get in trouble, but I had no choice) told them his name and the bouncers said ,\"Don't fuckin' lie. We are gonna search him up on Facebook and if you're lying you're in trouble.\" They cant find him at first and accuse me of lying, but I was telling the truth. Eventually they find him and at this point I have already apologised about 50 times to everyone around me, saying how I am so sorry for inviting them and how I had no idea he would do such a thing (I claimed that I had no idea he did graffiti, but I knew he did. I thought there was no point in saying I knew he did graffiti, as it would invalidate my word even though I was telling the truth - I truly had NO idea that Bill would do such a fucking stupid thing after I had told him not to...)\\n\\n\\nI continued to apologise as I wholeheartedly felt extremely guilty.. I could see everyone was very upset at what had happened. I was told to go home and I did. All of my friends had bailed, including Bill and I walked home, alone. I messaged the hosts of the party, saying that I was so sorry for what happened and how I would take full responsibility if the police could not contact Bill. They responded saying that their entire family was very, very upset and the mother and daughter were crying uncontrollably about everything that had happened. They told me to contact Bill and let him know that the police will be contacted if he does not go and apologise in person. I messaged Bill and told him what the go was. He said he understood and he was sorry (just to me). I'm not sure what he is planning on doing. He knows they know his name and school, so he'd be stupid to not go and apologise. \\n\\n\\nAm I an asshole for bringing Bill along, even though I had no idea he would do such a thing?\\nThanks, and have a happy new year :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",
       "1369  Hello. This has been on my mind for a long time ever since I did the deed so to speak. Over the summer I ended a relationship with my long term SO. I know for a fact that it wasnt a very good break up for her at all. Just wondering what the community thinks. I am so sorry this is so long. I donโt want to give a half story. Sorry!\\nBackground:\\nShe (19F) and I (19M) had known each other since beginning of high school. We dated on and off. 1st time was sophomore year and it ended badly. Went on dates every weekend, did typical BF+GF stuff [;)], but she didnโt want to advertise it at school. Thatโs fine whatever. After 6 months my friend said he saw her with another guy at lunch. I confronted her about it and she said she didnโt know her and I were in a relationship. Whatever. I moved on.\\nSeveral months passed and we got together again. I made it \"official\" or whatever (dating is confusing) and we were fine. I get a text randomly out of the blue one day saying she wants to end it, but won't give me a reason. She had a 4th of July party the next night that I was still invited to, so I went. Saw her there with her new guy. Confronted her again and she said that he was her 1st love and wanted to see if he changed (Irony is a bitch), but didnโt want to cheat on me. Needless to say I was pissed and we never spoke for 2 years I think? Fast forward to junior year. I left half way through the year to become home schooled. Got an email from her randomly apologizing for everything she's done to me, and wanting to reconnect. My thought process was \"She's matured a lot, Iโd be fine to give it another chance, but no plans on dating\". Well one thing lead to another and we ended up back in the saddle together.\\nCollege:\\n2.5 years was our last stretch. We went to the same college and lived together after our 1st year at the dorms. We fought here and there while at the dorms, a lot of which was her not being able to communicate to me at all. She couldn't tell me if something was wrong, what her opinions were on certain things, or make decisions on absolutely anything. Every argument I defused the best I could. We never had weeks of no talking or stupid passive aggressive shit, just arguments that resulted in her crying a lot for fear she would lose me.\\nI did always communicate if there was something wrong between us. Mainly her inability to communicate, how she didn't seem to care about money, and she seemed to put herself first. I had to help her with everything regardless of what I was doing. I had to help her pack, get on her ass about getting ready to go, and had to help her study, but with very little reciprocation from her. Most things were defused but then we moved into together. Now she had brought one of her horse to college with her. I was against this from the start, but I never argued with her about it. Her animals are her responsibility, and I understand itโs emotional. I was annoyed when she said she couldnโt give up her horse because it means too much to her. I had quite a few pets but I found them all homes, because I know college is a large financial and time burden. It was hard but I did it.\\nMoving in:\\nWhen it came time to move into together I let her really find a place. She had to look for a place to house the horse on the property, because she just COULD NOT drive to her horse, and she would not budge on that fact. I helped with a large list of places, that horse boarding, but not knowing what was needed she had free reign. We ended up moving in to some duplexes on the same boarding facility as her horses (she had brought down another one of hers and her mini-horse).\\nThat was hell. I found out she had no plans to get a job before moving into there and only got one out of luck at the boarding facility on site. She said she didn't have time, while I was working 2 jobs and other EC activities. We had to share a bedroom, and I was not happy. She had to have her massive waterbed (9ft by 4 ft) in a 10 ft by 10 ft room. She could have her things, but I was limited in what my things I could bring. I was technically not a resident there, the landlord was cool with us, but I was told if the city inspects it then I am not there. And on top of that we were 30 minutes away from the campus, with 1 vehicle (mine), and then she brought her dog with her that during the school year we would have to come back and check on twice a day. Our gas bill, with me driving to work alone was $300 monthly.\\nSo shit got bad and we argued about the same stuff. She couldn't talk to me about anything, her still being absurdly dependent on me for everything and just general day to day bullshit. This was not 1 way either. I was told that I get frustrated easily and I curse a lot when I am mad. So I watched my words when I was upset, and tried not to be frustrated, but honestly it was just her bullshit that was making me mad. So it progressed and these fights kept progressing. Nothing breakup worthy by themselves, but all together it was a mess.\\nThe Trip:\\nThen the catalyst. I took a trip to big bend for 2 weeks at the end of summer. I actually convinced her not to go, because I knew she couldn't handle the hikes, I didnโt want to hear the complaining, and I know she was going to be worried about the animals. I admit it was a slime ball thing to do, but I was thinking for myself. I didnโt tell her those reasons but she agreed to it. Definitely an Asshole for that. but I digress.\\nGot into a huuuuge fight the day before. I was still planning, packing etc. and we had to go home (3 hrs away) for a few days leading up to the trip. She HAD to see her family and whatnot. So I got what I could done and told her that we will just have to leave early on Sunday (trip left Monday at 6AM). Then it came. On Saturday she had a bitch fit at me because she NEVER gets to see her family and I wanted to go see my grandparents. We went home at least once a month and we both slept at her families house. I would see my family for 2-3 hours tops at a time. Then Sunday came around, and she was upset because I wanted to leave at 10AM to pack and get things ready, plus go to the stores. That was too early we fought and ended up leaving at 5PM. It was Sunday evening in the bible belt. Nothing was open when we rolled back into town after fighting for almost 3 hours. I just let it go not wanting to be mad at her before leaving on a trip. Next day we ride over there so she can drop me off. There was around a dozen other people there for the trip. She starts going off on the people Iโm going to hate on this trip. Rude, and wrong. I ended becoming really good friends with the ones she pointed out.\\nOn the trip I did a lot of thinking. Only got 4 hours of sleep a night from this. Talked to a few unbiased patrons and came to the conclusion that I should end it before it hits a breaking point. Didnโt want to end it on too bad terms. And she really was a good friend. Get back from the trip and that just escalates quickly. She pulled up and was pissed because I didnโt run down and lift her up out of the truck and swing her around or something (her words not mine). I just got off of a 10 hour van ride and had pulled my shoulder on the trail. I explained but she was still pissed. She then got more pissed that I was waiting on someone. One of my new friends on the trip had forgotten her stuff, so I was waiting for her to come back. She did I brought it to her and hugged her goodbye. My SO believed that I was acting tired around her just so I wouldnโt have to do anything, and I was suddenly energetic around my friend. We argued until 4AM. Next day I went out and found an apartment, and ended it with her that night. Had my bags packed up and I told her I wanted to end it before I end up hating her. 1st words out of her damn mouth were โI donโt know what Iโm going to doโ. She cried and what not and then came all the bs. I was told I was emotionally manipulative, and unreasonable. I did this 5 days before school started again and that was apparently too much shit for her. I was told that I should have done this during school when classes had settled or during the winter break. I merely contested that I could not lie to someone for months about how I feel especially in relationship that was failing. I also contested that there is no good time for a breakup. I didnโt bullshit, or mull around. I did what I thought was right.\\nFew weeks ago we met up for coffee so I could get a few things I left. I apologized for how things ended and how I didnโt want to fight as much. We had a lot of history together, that I donโt think was wasted. She kept throwing in there the guys she was hanging around and how she kissed the bassist of LA GUNS. I donโt know if I am over analyzing or sheโs trying to make me jealous. Iโm not a jealous type at all.\\nNow this is a me rant, but she really did love me. She did everything in her power to make me happy, and she still is, in some weirdly disconnected way my best friend. I had a lot of fun with her in between the fights and I do miss a lot of things. Things were not 24/7 bad between us, itโs just I saw that where it was going and didnโt want to end up enemies. I just want to know am I the asshole here for crushing her heart and doing so right before school started?   \n",

where it goes from here. Thanks reddit\\n\\n\\nFirst some information, I am 17 and she is 17, Her ex is 21 has no job, failed grade 12, no ambition, and they broke up because he was mooching money for alcohol, liquor and other things like that. I am the EXTREMELY jealous type. So a girlfriend talking to her ex is the worst. not to mention she was dating this guy for 4 years.\\n\\nThe other day she said she was in with in a coffee shop with him because he coincidentally walked in while she was there and she didn't want to be rude. I then found out that she actually drove him there.\\n\\nand then she told me that she was only with him because he texted her saying he was lonely and needed something to do and asked if she needed a pack of cigarettes.\\n\\nLast night I found out that she actually texted him first, like 7 times.\\nso not only did she hang out with him which is whatever, but she lied to me about it 3 times.\\nBut for some reason her and her friends think I'm the asshole for being upset.\\nSo tell me reddit, Am I the asshole or am I justified to be mad?\\n   \n",

                           So, my parents got a divorce a long time ago and my father got married again. I wouldn't mind this, I don't live in the same city as my father so I shouldn't have to deal with more or new people (I'm also an introvert). The problem arises when my dad wants to travel somewhere, as he will pick me up and take me in a 4 hour road trip with 2 step-brothers and a son exclusive to her, all of them under 5 years old crying and being annoying, which I even though find very uncomfortable barely manage to ignore. \\n\\nBut it all falls down when I have to interact with her. She is what one would colloquially call a germaphobe, she also has serious problems with her authority being challenged (Once I sat in the front seat for a trip, she flipped out because she wanted to sit there and finally decided not to come) probably because I'm 17 and she feels she is entitled to order those younger than her, she is quite religious and acts in ways to actively go against what would be convenient for me even if it is the best for everyone (once we had to go to a mall and also take me home, even though there was a mall right next to my house she decided we should go to the one closest to our current position, making me sit through 4 hours of watching shopping), all of which I find annoying.\\nI actively do things to annoy her as I find her reactions amusing, mostly unconsequential things, but not nearly as often as she does what I already mentioned.\\n\\nEdit: Well, I realized I skipped an important bit of information. It isn't a happy family, my dad agrees that she is wrong but doesn't confront her because it would be hell for him back at home.   \n",

  So, I'm not just some edgy teen, I'm 19 years old and actually consider myself to be agnostic bordering on catholic. I go to school full time and don't do much else. I never go out with friends or anything. I am fine going sometimes, but other times I am busy and don't have time/have more important things to do. Whenever I try to tell my mom this, she makes the same points: ie you live under my roof, it's very important to me, it's my job to make sure you don't go to hell, sometimes she even cries. It makes me feel very guilty, but at the same time, I'm an adult now and should be able to decide if I want to go to church or not, yeah?\\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole?   \n",

One of them [22M] is homosexual and attracted to me. Honestly, I'm uncomfortable with that fact - not the fact that he's gay but that he's sexually attracted to me. I just want to say now that I have 2 other good friends who are gay and I hang out with one of them a couple of times a week when I'm back in my home town and it's not awkward in the least - because why would it be? I don't give a shit that that friend is gay.\\n\\nMy housemate though: Sometimes when we're watching TV I'll look over and he's staring at me with a distant smile, for example. Whenever I make even a shit joke he'll laugh so loud and stare at me with some proud, longing expression that a wife would give to a husband she loves. It seems like he's always just trying to get attention from me and always seeking a positive response for every little action. Because of this, sometimes when he does little things that he obviously expects me to make a comment on or acknowledge I just stay completely silent. Last week I signed up to a friend's university research project data gathering session, and he came back to the house today telling me that he signed up for it as well. That's fair enough, I suppose, as we're mates to an extent but before I signed up for it he was laughing about it and saying 'no way I'm gonna sign up for that'. It just seems like he's always trying to be close to me and it kind of weirds me out. I like being by myself and to be honest it pissed me off that I don't get to do this thing by myself now.\\n\\nHe knows I'm straight, and he knows that I'm not interested in him in the least, apart from on a friendship level. But it's becoming hard to treat him the same as my other housemates because if I'm too nice then he just starts again. He'll start with the 'Oooh, thanks man, you're so niiiice :)\" or if we go to the shops he'll be like \"our first date, I'm so proud\". Whenever he makes a comment or something that conveys his attraction to me I generally just tell him \"shut the fuck up\" and change the conversational topic (but try to keep it civil on the new topic). It's rarely a direct comment but more often indirect one.\\n\\nAll of us in the house enjoy mutually abusive (in a jokey way) relationships, but I find myself being very minimally more cold towards him than my other housemates - it's as if I subconsciously feel I have to make him learn that there's nothing about me to love and I'm trying to get him to dislike me. However, this is a double-edged sword because one of the reasons he's into me is because I'm a tall guy and forceful / purposeful in my words and actions - he is really into my 'presence' apparently (he's a small guy and kind of obsessed with height).\\n\\nIt should probably be noted that I'm really bad with relationships of all kinds - I find it very hard to connect emotionally with people and struggle to generate and keep meaningful relationships with anyone; even my family. Even conventional, 'normal' relationships confuse and tire me. I'm 22, in my final year of university and haven't had a girlfriend here. I'm good looking and girls like me but don't go through the stress of getting with any and haven't brought any back to my house while we've been living together. Maybe he thinks (or hopes) I'm a closet homosexual and am just repressing my feelings? Although I doubt it as me and my other housemates have common conversations about certain celebrities on TV etc. and how we think they're hot.\\n\\nJust wanted to get this off my chest and ask you guys if I'm being the asshole here.   \n",

He's recently (in the past year) gotten his license, and is now on his Green Provisional (Where we live you have Learner license, Red Provisional and Green Provisional and then your full license).\\n\\nPreviously, I've called him out for creeping up over the speed limit when I'm in the car, to which he responds by slowing down, but protests or attempts to excuse it, each time. I used to think that was just his insecurities about someone chastising his actions (he's got middle child syndrome bad, and it's exacerbated by the fact that his family don't actually relate to him except to tell him when he's done something 'wrong'), and we're working on that. He's also admitted to speeding ('But not by much!') when he is driving late at night.\\n\\nWe've argued about this previously, and he knows I am very wary of bad driving habits (the city we live in has demonstrably the worst drivers in the country, with a young adult motor vehicle mortality rate that is nauseatingly high - one of our local politicians actually likened it to a meatgrinder). Every time, I've gotten so angry with his casual attitude and responses that I've had to tell him to drop the subject.\\n\\nAnd so, today has been... Challenging. Our university is doing a cross discipline theory unit, our lecturer doesn't know the material, so he and I are both frustrated by that. Furthermore, we have to do a group project which essentially doubles both of our study workloads.\\nOn top of that, Allan has been stressing over his personal assignment for this trimester, and is in a position of not really having any inspiration/a non workable concept that he's struggling to turn into a viable project. He's been sleeping badly, and has contacted his lecturers and tutors but then failed to follow up with a meeting or communicate effectively with them about his problems. \\nSo he's irritable and anxious, which he then inflicts on me, to which I respond by calling out his behaviour. I apologise for snapping at him, he apologises and acknowledges his behaviour, we move on. \\nBut today has been one incident after another, which has left both of us rather irritated. \\n\\nWhen I returned home, he'd messaged me to tell me he'd gotten a speeding fine for being 7km/h over the speed limit (want to mention, being under/over speed limit by 5 km/h here is an offense). It's dated from Valentines Day, near my suburb, where he'd gone from work to a local supermarket to pick up desert, and then sped to my house. He has no points left on his Provisional license, and it's a $100 fine. I'm happy to help him pay it off, but it's just the perfect end to an overly shitty day.\\n\\nI said I'd help him pay off the fine, and his response seemed to lack any sort of acknowledgement of the fact that he'd done something wrong. \\nSo I did something very stupid. \\nI asked him to be more mindful about his speed. I really shouldn't have done that. I just hoped he'd change his attitude or behaviour now that he had actually been fined for it. I worried, because it seemed completely bizarre to me that there was no contrition or recognition of his error. And usually he's VERY good at acknowledging when he's been at fault.\\nImmediately, he made the excuse of 'I'm 7 km/h over'. \\nI nearly lost my shit, but told him I wouldn't argue about it with him, that even from a monetary perspective, he shouldn't be doing it, and that we should drop the subject. \\nHis response was 'Forgive me for not sitting perfectly on the speed limit at 9 PM on an empty street on a Sunday that's also Valentines Day.' \\nI told him 'It could be my birthday, my funeral, don't care.'\\nI then told him I loved him and that he should go rest - he hadn't slept more than three hours, and I just needed to leave the conversation because I was furious. \\n\\nAfter all this, he literally has tangible evidence of the repercussions of his behaviour - which has potentially more dire consequences than a fine and a slap on the wrist - and he's trying to justify his actions by making it my fault.\\n\\nNow I just feel kind of hollow and disappointed with his reaction, and I totally admit I shouldn't have taken the bait, I shouldn't have started an argument with him about this shit. \\nI'm hoping it was the shitty day, the aggravation, exhaustion and stress, and getting this crap news on top of all of this, and that he's just operating from a crappy headspace.\\n\\nSo I know I am the asshole, but I just want to know if I'm the only asshole in this situation.\\n\\nTL;DR I'm an asshole, but do I have company?   \n",

                                                               So im in high school (UK), ( year 9) and I like to go out locally with friends after it most nights, but my cousin who is three years older than me (16) started hanging out with us. He clearly makes my friends uncomfortable (although they didn't say anything). I also don't like the way he acts in front of them. So the question is am i the asshole for going out with my friends and not inviting him?\\n   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              So, during my childhood, I had a very abusive mother.  I don't want to get into specifics but for my entire life, my mother has been very manipulative and abusive towards me (emotionally and verbally).  When I turned 15, I went to live with my aunt and haven't seen or spoken to my mother since (I am 19 now).  I have been going to therapy for many years now and have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd.  My predicament is, I have a very good relationship with my dad which is suffering from my avoiding my mother.  My mother is very resentful of my independence and resents it when me and my dad spend time together.  My dad doesn't understand why I can't have a relationship with my mother and often tells me he wishes I could be around her to make her happier.  I don't want to lose my relationship with my dad but I just don't feel like I can confront my mother at this point in my life.  So I ask you reddit, am I the asshole for being stubborn for not wanting to have any contact with my mother?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                              I don't know why I care about this and it bothers me that I spend any time worrying about something so trivial and stupid but here I am. \\n\\nI think it stems from having been the \"push over\" friend through out most of my childhood. I was always just generally someone who didn't stand out, I guess. I had 2/4 high school birthdays where my classmates forgot my birthday and nothing happened aside from last minute throwing something together like \"oops we forgot sorry\". Plus I was vocal about the approaching date, just no one cared. What am i going to decorate my own locker? Lol\\n\\nSo here I am, 25 years old, thinking those days are behind me.\\n\\nI work at a bank where it's 90% women in my department. As much as I hate the stereotype that women are \"cliquey\" that's exactly the atmosphere here. There's currently a 20 year age gap between me and the rest of my department. All the older women operate like the high school girls I hated and I'm never included in anything unless it's the entire department being invited. I've never really cared much until recently.\\n\\nMy office started doing balloons for people's birthdays. I knew the minute this began, I wasn't getting one. So what did I do? A few days before my birthday I made my work instant message status something like \"birthday in 5 days\" so people would know. I get to work the day after my birthday (birthday was Sunday) luckily, expecting nothing and I got nothing. It was fine, or so I thought.\\n\\nNow my bosses birthday just past and my other coworkers birthday is today and they both got balloons PLUS they want me to come out to dinner for my bosses birthday. (Let me just mention that a total of three people said happy birthday to me on the Monday after my birthday, only one was in my department). Also last year I was at a different location for my birthday, got no birthday wishes but was asked to attend dinner for my bosses birthday.\\n\\nI'm asking if I'm the asshole here because I feel like an asshole. I just feel so stupid for caring about something so incredibly stupid!! I think it's just walking past their desks having to stare at this crap that bugs me. It's like high school me is coming back because it reminds me of walking past all the decorated lockers when mine was bare. \\n\\nSo everyone, how pathetic am I?   \n",

    So a friend (26f) and I (23m) started hanging out about 8 months ago. We got drinks after work with a group of coworkers one night, got to talking, and became fast friends. Easy to talk to, gets stuff I've been through and vice versa, and really is just on the same page as me in a lot of things. The problem is that her boyfriend (28m) doesn't like us hanging out. I've done everything I can to try to put his mind at ease but I don't know where to go from here. The three of us have gone out together, we've gone on \"double dates\" with the girl I'm talking to, and I've even gone drinking with just him before. My friend and I have both told him there's nothing going on but she still gets crap every time we hang out and any time I see him I get passive aggressive comments about it. I feel bad for her because she has to deal with it even though she doesn't seem to be too bothered with it and I don't really care what he thinks at this point. I'm not going to stop being friends with her because her boyfriend (I think) is being too jealous. Am I the asshole?   \n",

mom and stepdad. I'm 20 years old.\\n\\nEvery couple months, my older brother comes to visit us for the night. We watch TV, have a drink, and talk.\\n\\nMy family likes to watch movies, so usually when my brother comes over, eventually someone recommends we watch a movie together. However, I'm not a big movie watcher at all. It is difficult for me to sit still while watching movies, and I get nauseating anxiety at the thought of sitting together with my family for the length of a film.\\n\\nSo when someone brings up the idea of watching a movie, I very quickly decline. This makes a big fuss with everyone else. All three argue that I don't spend enough time with them -- and that if I just give it a chance, I'll enjoy the movie. I argue that I don't feel like watching a movie, and that it's making me very anxious.\\n\\nI repeatedly say, \"no,\" but they implore me to stay and watch. I end up storming upstairs and staying in my room until the movie is over. After the movie is over, the berating from my family continues for a few more minutes.\\n\\nThis same situation has happened twice. Am I the asshole for relentlessly refusing to watch a movie?\\n\\n*(As a side note, this is not an issue exclusive to my family. Even with close friends, I don't like watching movies.)*   \n",

They are Christians but I am not. They want me to give 10% of *my earnings* to a god I do not believe in. I still live in their house (I'm 15) so I kind of have to do what they say. Am I the asshole for not wanting to sacrifice my hard earned money to something I don't believe in?   \n",

Doesn't happen every year, but often enough that it doesn't matter to me. \\n\\nSo I go over to my mom's house for dinner and cake. I'd already had a kind of crappy day. My boyfriend was being a jerk, it just didn't feel much like my birthday at all. \\n\\nI'd already gotten my presents from my mom, and my siblings both told me they had ordered my gift but it hadn't arrived yet. NBD.\\n\\nDinner was great, and then my mom brings out the cakes. 2 of them. Uh..what? \\n\\n\"We never did anything for your sister's birthday, so I figured we'd knock em both out at once.\"\\n\\nMind you, her birthday was 4 months ago, not last week or anything. \\n\\nCue everyone singing Happy Birthday to her first, and then me. Cue my grandma giving us the same exact card with the same $20 bill inside. Literally the only present I got on my birthday. \\n\\nEverybody ate her cake instead of mine, also. \\n\\nSo am I the asshole for being upset? I feel like she had 4 months to do cake and dinner for my sister, and could have picked literally any day other than MY birthday. \\n\\nI'm 24, she's 22.   \n",

house, owned, bills are fine. \\nMy grandmother receives her retirement money monthly, relatives visit very often. \\nMy father is ALWAYS between jobs, currently figuring his life out, he's not working at the momment. He's always trying to get schemes for money (not ilegal stuff, but not entirely a good thing to rely on). Spend most of his time at home on social medias, watching TV, hanging out with friends and uncles and drinking beer. TLDR, I think he's not a responsible person.\\nI already help out on bills (internet mostly, and a few supermarket things like food and house's material), which is around 300$ a month. \\nI've been recently asked by my father to help out more (financially, more 200$) at home. I do not refuse these kind of things, so I agreed. BUT, I used to live by myself a year ago (in another state), moved out back due to family issues and study opportunity. Anyway, I wish to move out and live by myself once again (split bills with friends, same and currently city where my father and grandmother live), which would cost me around $900 a month (bills, food and college) or so.\\nThe thing is: Am I the asshole for moving out and \"leave\" my father and grandmother? Last time I moved he didn't react very well, kept a cold relationship with me for doing that. Oh, I'm 24, male.\\n\\nEDIT 1: Thank you all for your honest replies. I'll stat college in a couple months, and I will keep my plan of moving out. I need to live my life and fight my fights!   \n",

I have a car, she hasn't had a car in probably 2 years. I always drive her to the gym, or a friend's house, or whatever to the point that I have to fill up on gas once a week at least, and she doesn't pay for anything. Now that I am out of college for the summer, she's asking me more often to take her places. AITA for not wanting to? I mean, I have no reason to say no other than just not wanting to...\\n\\nEDIT:\\nWe do live together at our mother's house. It's only 20 minutes from my University so I thought \"Why not save money for a few years?\" My father, who is not my sister's dad, pays for the insurance on the car, but both he and I are on the title because he lives in another state and I had a police officer stalking me because the car was still registered in his state. He gave it to me towards the end of my sophomore year of high school. He pays the insurance and for emergency maintenance, but I pay for everything else. One of the conditions though of me having his car was that no one other than me and him, and of course my mother (because she's my mother and I will always respect what she asks of me), can drive it. Also, due to my sister's driving history, I don't really trust it anyway. As for why my sister doesn't have a car, my mom got her a car when she was in high school, then she went off to college and kept parking in places that she wasn't supposed to and kept getting it towed. Finally, my mom got tired of it and took the car back from where it was sitting in a tow lot about to be sold for being there too long. My sister leased a car, got into an accident. Got another crappy car, had another accident without insurance, then got into some legal issues. Ever since then, and after moving back home, she's been driving my mom's car to work and using me for rides. She's been living with us ever since. She also doesn't have any money to buy a car because she owes student loans and for stealing about $1,000+ from my mom's credit card. I'm probably driving her about 40+ miles a week. Alternatives would be Uber, or a taxi, but my thing is that she's making all of these plans with friends to go to all of these places and parties so why can't she get her friends to drive her to said places? Why make the plans and then ask me or my mom if we have the possibility of saying no and then she's SOL about getting to said places that she planned to go to? \\n\\nAnother note would be that my car is 16 years old and has almost 300,000 miles on it. So there's that, in case ya'll were wondering about the condition of the car.   \n",

                          So at the beginning of May I(23) moved out of my brother's house because I became extremely unhappy living there.\\n\\nSo some backstory. My brother(27) lived in another province and decided he was going to move home around Christmas. He bought a house here so he has somewhere to live when he came back. From September to December I lived in his house and did my best to take care of it and even got furniture for the house, a TV, internet, cable, etc. \\n\\nCome December when he moved back everything was okay for a little while, but started to get upset at everything I did. I tried so hard to make him feel at home but apparently it wasn't good enough. He would get upset if I had friends over, or didn't clean enough, which was all I did almost everyday. He never cleaned his own house.\\n\\nThen February comes, he decided to adopt a giant 95 dog, which I was fine with. The problem is he was at work almost 9 hours a day, so I was stuck constantly taking care of his dog. I was a student at the time so I was home a lot. Then the dog started destroying everything. Mostly eating and chewing MY things. I expressed my concern to him and how I felt it was unfair I was stuck taking care of his dog and I didn't want to live my life around a dog. He didn't take it well and refused to get rid of this dog so I ended up moving back to my parents.\\n\\nNow I hear he's telling MY friends how I'm a jerk for moving out on him and he doesn't understand why. That really bothered me and I am not on good terms with him at all now. I tried to be very civil with him but nothing worked.\\n\\nI know this is kind of confusing, but does it make me an asshole?   \n",

                 Some more information, I'm 19 years old and my girlfriend in 18. We do not live together or share any assets what so ever. I've had my car since I passed my test at 17 (I live in the UK). I've grown up around cars and bikes all my life so it's a big part of my life. I've had my eye on a BMW E30 and I recently found one with good mileage and at an affordable price. Any person reading this who likes cars will know my reasons for wanting this car. So I rung the guy about buying it to get more information etc. So I'm going to see the car this weekend. I told her about it and showed her photos, the main reason she doesn't want me to get it is because 'it's ugly'. She also went on to say how it's stupid because it's 25 years old and will constantly break down, I understand her reasoning behind saying it but old BMW's are very reliable and rugged cars. I've been working hard this year in my apprenticeship and I feel like I deserve to buy this car, so I'm going to buy it, but she just doesn't understand why I want it because it's ugly and doesn't belive that it'll last a day before I get problems with it. I'm buying this car because I've worked hard and it is honestly one of my dream cars to own and I have an opportunity to buy it now so I'm taking that chance. We got into an argument about it as I was taking her home from work earlier and I just want to know am I the ass hole for going to buy this car even though she doesn't want me to?   \n",

have some narcissistic tendencies, and I am also extremely introverted and stuck in a pretty socially demanding job right now. I also run my own business on the side. With that in mind, my main question is about whether I'm the asshole for working 60+ hours a week and not wanting to have to be around extended family members on weekends when I finally get time off (note that I work about 50% of weekends)? More specifically, I have admittedly \"plotted\" to not be home when I knew relatives would be coming over our house, because I didn't have the energy to socialize and I wanted to go somewhere where I could just be alone. If I stayed home but in my room, my parents would be even MORE offended, because then it's obvious that I'm home and avoiding the company. But even with my leaving the house, they're STILL offended!\\n\\nI'm perfectly content with only seeing these relatives on holidays. My parents insist that I should make a concerted effort to see these relatives on a regular basis and that I should intentionally stick around when I know we're having company over the house, that it's rude not to, and that these relatives have now \"caught on\" that I'm conveniently never home when they're here and they're \"hurt\" about it.\\n\\nI think it's freaking ridiculous. I am 30 years old. I pay rent to live here. Yet apparently if we have company here it means I MUST be around for it for at least part of the time, even if I didn't invite them? Am I the asshole?   \n",

serious ideological difference.\\n\\n I am taking an online course over the summer. The material is fairly easy, but it takes a lot of time to do. Because it is summer and I still want to have a social life and some leisure time, I have been trying to figure out how to minimize the amount of work I do while still learning the material and getting an A in the class. However, my mother thinks that this idea is terrible as I should be putting 100% of my efforts into every thing I do, and that the idea of trying to calculate how much effort to put in to \"scrape by\" is just lazy, and won't fly in the \"real world\".\\n\\nAlso I feel like she is trying to micro manage my schedule, and the fact that she gets an email with a grade report every day just makes it worse. \\n\\nIs this a legitimate problem, or is it just a petty teenage gripe, and who do you think is in the wrong?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My dad and 2 brothers have been working at turning our basement into a man cave for when friends come to visit, so that theyโre not hogging the TV or making a mess of the living room. Weโve all worked together to paint, sand, and tile and now weโre at the point of getting the entertainment for this area. The Man Cave is, in theory, for everyone but in reality I will never use it. I have a nice TV in my bedroom, and am almost never home to use it as it is. When I do hang out with my friends itโs literally never at my house. This is a thing for my 2 brothers to take advantage of, when their friends come over to watch a sports ball game or whatever. \\n\\nStill, even though I will not be using it I both offered and agreed to contribute my Xbox One to the project so that they can play their games and watch their shows. All thatโs left is acquiring TV, about $600-$1000 is what theyโre expecting to spend on a decent one. Well, now they (And by โTheyโ I mainly mean my dad) is trying to get me to go in about $200 on the TV. Iโve tried explaining that my contribution was the Xbox and games which I could have easily sold for more than that amount (Itโs the Halo 5 Edition) and do not intend on contributing any cash. Aside from the fact that shelling out $200 would destroy my entire 2 week budget, which is tight in the best of times, I will not be using this area at all. I did not need to just give them my Xbox and games, and am getting rather pissed off at being pressured into helping with the TV as well. I get that splitting it 4 ways is easier than splitting it 3 but its money that I just donโt need to spend on a luxury like that. \\n\\nBut now Iโm wondering; since this is technically a Family Project, Am I The Asshole for not wanting something towards the TV? \\n\\nEDIT: Additional Info\\nI'm 26 Years old and living at home. I only live at home because most of my income goes to helping with household expenses, though some of it is cultural as well. \\nI bought the Xbox and the TV in my room with my own money, the TV was purchased years ago. \\n   \n",

My cousin and I, both 20, were planning a trip to go a gaming convention 5 hours from where we live. After planning, I told him to buy the tickets for the convention for us. He then invited other people to the gaming event that were already there. In total, we would be 6. \\n\\nMy cousin and I then planned for him to drive us to the location after I finished working at 3 pm that Friday, so we would get there at 8 pm and have Saturday to do whatever we wanted and then the gaming convention on Sunday.\\n\\nWe then booked and airbnb for a total of 500$ for the duration of our trip that we would split 50/50. \\n\\nHe started talking to one of the girls coming to the event that he invited and fell in love (making it simpler than it truly is). He then asked me if it was ok to go to the event Friday morning to go see her. I said \"ok\", even thought booking a train would cost me 50$ and I would come at 11 pm to let him have the day to have a date, so I booked a train (nonrefundable ticket).\\n\\nI then proceeded to ask him what we would do on Saturday and he said we would go to an amusement park with all his friends. (Just a little note: I am really an introvert and I have a lot of difficulty socializing with a group). So hence a cousin trip became a group trip. I felt like I would be left out at all occasions due to my awkwardness and inability to socialize. I also felt, since he was in love, he would leave me out and put all his attention to this girl. I proceeded to tell him about what I felt and how if he also tried to make me be liked by his friends, he wouldn't enjoy the trip as much as if I wasn't there. \\nMy cousin then told me if I didn't want to go, I shouldn't, but he would want me to go. \\nI decided not to go, letting him go with his friends. I haven't spoke with him since.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not going with my cousin to this convention?\\n\\n   \n",

                                                 I'm moving into my first apartment next month. I am 18 (almost 19) F, and I have three roommates who I think are 20ishF. We're all college students. Our apartment is a 4/4, so we each have our own bedrooms and bathrooms. All utilities are included in our rent except for electricity, which we split four ways and is usually very low from what I've heard. Two of the girls currently live there; me and another girl are replacing two other girls who are moving out.\\n\\nOne of my best friends \"Kayla\" is living in a dorm this year. She is working at a restaurant on campus, and needs to come up the week before school starts for job training. However, the dorm housing people didn't approve her request for an early move-in, so she doesn't have anywhere to stay for the four days before the dorms open. Naturally, I told her she was welcome to stay with me. I thought nothing of it since the only spaces I share with my roommates are the kitchen and the living room, and Kayla is incredibly shy so she won't be coming out there much anyway.\\n\\nMy roommates and I have a group chat that we made so we can see who has what for the apartment, decide what we still need, that sort of thing. A few days ago I texted the group chat and let them know that my friend Kayla would be staying with me from X date to Y date (four days).\\n\\nLater, one of my roommates \"Jordan\" replies, and her tone sounds really pissed off. It's probably pertinent to note that Jordan is one of the two who already lives in the apartment. I'd copy the whole text, but it was really long and pretty convoluted so I'll sum up. She basically said that that isn't the way we run things in the apartment, that we always get the other girls' permission before having guests, even if it's just for one night. She said she wasn't comfortable having a stranger in her home and asked me to tell Kayla she wasn't welcome to stay. The other two girls didn't say anything.\\n\\nI texted Jordan outside the group chat and told her that I wasn't going to uninvite my friend who needed a place to stay. I said I understand her concerns, and if I had someone who planned to stay longer than a week or so I would get everyone's approval first, but that I don't think I need her permission to host a guest in my bedroom for a couple days.\\n\\nJordan replied and brought up the electricity bill, and that she thinks it'll skyrocket with one more person staying there. (For four days?? I seriously doubt that, but I've never paid an electricity bill before so that's something I admit I'm in the dark on.) She said that if I insist on having an \"unwelcomed\" guest, I should pay more for the electricity bill that month. I told her we could talk about it when I move in in two weeks and didn't respond anymore.\\n\\nAITA for inviting my friend to stay in my room with me? I didn't think there was any way I could be since I have my own space, but now I'm not so sure. Is asking permission for every guest excessive, or is my roommate right? Should I offer to pay more for the electricity?   \n",

I hated (And still hate) his guts, but was too scared to tell my teachers what was going on at home.\\n\\nMy dad eventually developed dementia, likely brought on by him drinking himself into it. He's had it for close to 10 years now (He was in his 50s when he was diagnosed) and my mom took care of him before she died. She did get POA over him, but she gave it back to him when she thought he had \"got better.\" (Yes, I knew that was fucking dumb. I miss her, but WTF?)\\n\\nI thought he had medicaid. So, my plan was when his condition worsened I'd stick him in a nursing home. However, I don't know when exactly, but he was switched to medicare because he (Or my mom, again I'm not sure when nor is anyone in the family) had allowed too much money into his bank account. That money sure as shit wasn't there when his condition worsened last year. I couldn't find anything to tell where, exactly, he had blew his money to. I was able to get him to give me POA, but at this point it was too little too late with nothing but a nicely worded \"Tough shit\" from the social worker who was helping me.\\n\\nI have told my mom's side of the family that I don't want to take care of him and that I, quite honestly, don't feel a shred of sympathy for him and they offer verbal support and say they don't blame me one bit. My dad's side, however, says I'm \"morally obligated\" to take care of my father regardless of how he treated me growing up (They also say he couldn't help the drinking nor the abuse since it's \"in the genes\") and that I'm a disgusting human being for not sympathizing with him for (probably) putting himself in this condition, occasionally saying if I don't I will have \"Failed my mom\". So, are they right? AITA?   \n",

I (29f) have a friend (45f) who I met back in 2007 as she hired me. I was an exemplary employee and we were friends that respected the work/boss boundary. We haven't worked for said company for years, but we stayed close since. She's seen me work my ass off during my twenties. Despite the age difference, she's never had her financial shit in order. I have ALWAYS made substantially less than her/then husband. She borrowed $40 during a time when I could barely afford to eat because she really needed it. Because of the petty amount (albeit I needed it), I didn't mention anything... until years later when she was bragging about how she pays everyone back. I just mentioned it out of principal. \\n\\nShe started working for a large finance company and gained the employment by a referral. She recommended me and I was first interviewed in 2008  before the global economic crisis mandated hiring freezes on the finance sector. I didn't get the job, but in all fairness, I didn't have experience. I ended up getting into banking two years later and worked my ass up into a lending role. Back in 2014, I applied on her recommendation. This was while I had banking experience (asset), but not yet lending. I was passed in favour of a candidate that did have just a little bit more, but was told it was a very difficult position.\\n\\nSometime last year, I was doing better financially. Same friend has always been poor at managing her money (she makes about 20k more than I do, but with similar expenses). I wanted to go on  a weekend trip.. she desperately wanted to go but couldn't afford accommodation but said she'd chip in with food. I was OK with that. We went shopping for groceries and she started loading the cart excessively as though we were there for a week. I didn't moderate her because she said she'd pitch in for groceries. The entire weekend came and went, and she didn't spend a dime but took money out for activities for herself. I was perplexed, and followed up when we went home. I was a bit aggressive about it because I felt exploited. She felt really bad about her behavior. She paid me back (not what I was expecting). Time goes on, and I let it go.\\n\\nI quit my job after carefully saving up living expenses for a year. I took a job that an old contact sold me on. Completely based on lies. Staff is absolutely terrible and toxic. I get bullied and alienated. Friend knows this and is excited to tell me mid June that same company is hiring. By July I haven't heard anything, but she reassures me that they're just busy. I feel like an asshole, but don't ask her specifics by mid July. I just vented that with everything going on at my new job, that I was feeling very discouraged that I hadn't heard from them. I was on the receiving end of some bad news that affected me economically and I briefed her on that. During this time, she hits me up about three different times for money. I lent her $100 with the expectation that I'd get it back on 07/29 (Payday). The other two times, she found other arrangements before I could get back to her.\\n\\nToday I decided to touch base with her to simply ask her thoughts if she thinks I should touch base with the recruiter that I originally spoke to briefly or if she thought it would be too aggressive for me to follow up in person with the hiring manager that might recall that I was passed over. I was feeling very confused, because the job requirements cite one year of data entry experience and a highschool diploma. I am an excellent candidate and knock off everything they're looking for, including assets.  She hasn't paid me back the $100 that she said she'd pay back on the 29th. So I thought that I wasn't being a douchebag with disrespecting her boundaries since it would seem like she clearly didn't have an issue with violating mine.\\n\\nShe responds back that sorry, they hired someone... maybe talk to the recruiter, she says, as per my original query. \\n\\nI can't help but feel pissed because she knew how desperately i was looking to quit my job.i only stayed there so I don't have to account for a failed job experience. I feel it's reasonable to keep your friend informed not only about when they started interviewing, but more importantly that they had hired someone. I'm not sure if those points are valid, or if it's the fact that I've lent someone money whose breached my trust with money. Kind of like.. well, you don't respect me, so why should I respect you? \\n\\nAm I being the asshole here for feeling like I've been wronged? Would I be the asshole for calling her out on the fact that she sat like a waiting duck with Intel while I was going through hell? \\n\\ntl;dr AITA for being mad at my long-term friend for keeping me out of the loop for a job that she referred me for when she knew i was holding out to quit my job?   \n",

cringe-worthy, awkward, and uncomfortable as you could possibly imagine.\\n\\nWe'll call him Jay. 23 y/o male. I'm 21. Our background is that we met at a bar and I impulsively moved him in at the beginning of July. We began feeling like we didn't really click, in the end, and we both came to acknowledge that. I broke us up about a week ago.\\n\\nJay went through my phone after we just had sex, and read all the text messages I made to a few different guys hours prior about how I was trying to plan how I spend my free/fun time in the long run/course of the next whenever.\\n\\nI've only slept with one guy once since we broke up, and I told him that, but he asked me before storming out if fucking me was going to prevent me from sleeping with other people, despite the fact that we openly know we're not compatible with each other in many, if any aspects of a tender, nurturing relationship.\\n\\nHe told me he felt used, but I was the one that made the ground rules that we as free individuals can choose who we want, when we want, as long as neither of us brought them back home with us to fuck in our bed, which I hadn't done.\\n\\nThat was our only boundary that we agreed on.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I know I'm at least 50% asshole, because I'm aware that you really shouldn't sleep with your exes, especially when they're hyper emotional, but I just feel like in order to avoid being a hypocrite and breaking my own house rules, to take him when we're both needy.\\n\\nEdited: More detail.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Last night (as of this post), my girlfriend of six years (22) and I (M/23) were getting ready for bed when she was bringing up buying herself a used car. She looked at me and said \"Will you help me buy a car?\" I said \"How?\" She replied, \"Just help pay for it.\" \"How much?\" I asked. \"All of it.\"\\n\\n             Now, before I continue, I should also make clear that our relationship is not that strong. We fight almost all of the time. In fact, almost all of our fights end with her threatening to leave, so because she does this often, I usually reply with \"Fine, go ahead,\" or something along those lines. I should also note that she makes more than I do, but she has more bills to pay. So, continuing, I said, nicely, \"Babe, you know I can't give you all of it.\" I thought she was just joking and she'd say something like, \"Yeah, I know,\" but instead she asks, \"Why not?\"\\n\\n          I could hear her tone change. I respond kindly, again, \"Because I just can't give all of it. I can help a little.\" \"What do YOU need it for?\" Her tone becomes a little more belittling. I believed she was taking a shot at me for not having as many bills as she does. I was really astonished, because she's been hounding me to save my money and not spend it on anything, big or small. \"I need to save up for the semester coming up. Babe, you can't have it all.\" To save time, she goes on a tirade about how after six years, people would think I was being irrational for not giving her all of my money. I argued differently. Finally, she ends it with, \"I was just testing you anyway. I wanted to see if you would and now I have my answer.\"\\n\\n            I lost my shit as much as a normally passive person would. I said, not shouted, \"Are you kidding me? You know our relationship is pretty rocky, why would you test it so recklessly, if at all? You're the one who told me to start saving my money, so why would you expect me to give it all to you? I would if it were a dire situation, like getting kicked out or medical bills.\" \"It doesn't matter,\" she said, \"I have my answer. I can't imagine being with someone who wouldn't do all that they can for the one their with AFTER SIX YEARS.\" We then argued about who was in the wrong. We stopped and she laid down facing the other way, and I did the same. She shut off the TV and we fell asleep without saying a word. SO, if I'm the asshole, please let me know and I will grovel my way back into her good graces.   \n",

One of the guys on my shift is much older than myself (he's 62 I'm 29) and try's to blow a lot of my direction off.  \\n\\nThis is mainly in the case of safety violations, and to an extent I can imagine his issues (I know that safety was not as much of a concern when he was my age, and I can imagine its not easy having someone less than half your age be your boss). \\n\\nThe other day he completely blocked a fire extinguisher, a huge OSHA violation.  When I brought it to his attention his response was \"if there is a fire I'm just going to run out of the building\" and then he drove off.  This is a typical response from him and I have yet to do anything serious about it.\\n\\nSo I took him aside and told him he needs to work with me, \"I can't keep letting this stuff slide\". He got upset and told me that if I can't take a joke then \"fuck me\". \\n\\nSo I sent him home.  Now I feel awful lol. \\nAITA?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

She went over a friend's (22/m) house to watch wrestling while I was at work. Normally I'm cool about it, her best friend is a guy. Anyway she hungout there for awhile and they always text and whatnot but a few weeks ago, she told me that he got drunk and said he \"should've fucked her in high school so he'd have bragging rights since she is hot now\". I for one got livid and told her I didn't like her hanging around him, but she still went last night and today I asked her to stop all contact with him. AITA?   \n",

                      So I am now a senior in high school and my dad no longer wants to drive me 30 minutes everyday to the private school he's making me go to. He tells me I need to get my license and accept responsibility for myself now because I am an adult. He says I should be driving just like everyone else my age is and he shouldn't be driving a 17 year old around anymore... I told him I don't like driving as it makes me very anxious and nervous and tense (probably because of the bad car accidents i was in when i was a kid) and it also makes me very on edge for the rest of the day. I've practiced driving a bunch but i really hate doing it. I'd much rather just take a bus or walk but sadly there's no way to do that in this case scenario. I'm not sure what else to say so if there's any other info needed feel free to ask and i'll answer your questions.   \n",

Me(M19) and Nicole(F19) were on a trip with our classes to another country. Our classes stayed in the same hotel, for 4 days and 3 nights. Boys for themselves, and girls for themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNicole and I had known each other for a few months. She had just moved to our school and we became good friends in a short time. Nicole has a boyfriend, Jeff(M21), who's a very jealous type, but chose to trust that I wouldn't hit on(flirt with) Nicole. I wasn't interested in her anyways. Only as friends. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo at this trip, everyone got drunk, day and night, including me. But Nicole doesn't drink. So she was sober the whole time. She would lean up against me at night when we went to a mall or restaurant to eat. As in, her back, tightly up against my front. Often. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery night, Nicole would come into my room. She would lay on my bed, and I on my roommate's bed. He would always be out partying, so we had the room for ourselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery time Nicole left my room in the morning, my classmates would see her leave, so they're my witnesses. As their rooms were right next to mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last night, I threw up, drunk and dizzy. We both lay on the same bed. And she moved her hips forward and backwards, kinda humping my left leg. I held my hands around Nicole and put her on top of me. And she would, willingly, keep moving her hips in motion around my crotch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNicole leaned forwards at the same time so our heads would be right next to each other, while still moving her hips. I didn't make the move, to go for it. Nicole then got up and repeatedly said \"I can't do this, I have a boyfriend\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJeff called her while she was in my room, Nicole lied to Jeff and said she was in my room, so she could help me because I threw up and was dizzy and so on. She would then leave the room. We didn't tell anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast forward almost 6 months, Nicole chose to tell Jeff about what happened. But Nicole told a different story, that I tried to rape her on the last night, but that she managed to lock herself in the bathroom of my hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew Jeff, but we were only aquaintances. So I choose to travel almost 50 km to meet him, alone, and tell Jeff the truth. But before I managed to finish my first sentence, Jeff hit me. And started stomping my face while I lay on the ground. Spitting too. I didn't fight back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm 190 cm. Strong build. I could easily eat Jeff, who's short, tiny, and weak, but I didn't. I'm kind of a pacifist and also I felt a bit guilty. But I feel like his anger should've gone towards Nicole, and not me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter he left, I called Jeff. Told the truth. He acted like he believed me, and said they weren't together anymore. But after almost a year, I saw them, still together. I don't care that they are together or what not. I just feel bad for him. Nicole clearly has Jeff around her little finger. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm just pissed that I took a beating and he didn't get anything back. I can easily get my revenge. But I'm also kind of a pacifist, so it's a bit of a struggle, I guess. He has cousins from my city, but they don't dare to say anything to me, because I have people behind me, whom they are scared of. Jeff didn't knew this before he beat me. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter I took the beating, one of my boys threatened Jeff and he got scared. But I said to my boys that I don't look for revenge. My cousin then chose to speak with Jeff, and he cried this time over the phone. Scared. He isn't man enough to travel almost 50 km to meet up, in my city. I told my cousin not to do anything about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the whole situation, a boy, Sam(M20) from the same class as Nicole, came and told me that Nicole kissed him on his cheek before the trip. Sam told Nicole that he has a girlfriend, and that he did nothing wrong there (when Nicole kissed him on the cheek). Sam tried to confirm to me that Nicole is bad, and not me...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. And sorry for the bad English, it's not my native tongue. Feel free to ask any questions. If you didn't understand a part of the story, please say so, so that I may try to explain it a bit better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole? I just want this cleared up for me, so that I maybe might feel a bit better with myself. (I feel like this should maybe be posted in /r/offmychest?) Thank you.   \n",

So after 1 and 1/2 weeks of empty promises of promotions and an actual promise of a raise I decided to leave still. It was well established that my last day would be this last Friday, but last Sunday my boss told me I had to work Saturday because that's the rest of the pay week. But I told him I had other obligations, (I saw friends I haven't seen all summer). I belive he was milking me for days because he couldn't find a replacement. \\n\\nYesterday on Friday we were clocked out and he said \"4 o'clock tomorrow\" and I said I told you today was my last day. He continued with \"no it's not, you are working tomorrow\". I again said no I'm not I have shit to do. He said \"I have a replacement next week not this week\". Side note the \"replacement\" is just a prep cook that took the weekend off. I said that is not my problem I gave you two weeks to find a replacement that's why I put in a notice. He got so angry he told me \"If you do not come in tomorrow I will fucking destroy you\" I said whatever and turned around to leave. He then asked if I was coming in at 4 again, and I yet again said no. This made him livid so he followed me out and stood in the door and screamed at me until I was 2 blocks down the rode walking. He called me a weak faggot, screamed \"THIS IS THE REAL ME\" and told me \"he would destroy me\" yet again, among other things. \\n\\nAITA for not just coming in Saturday or am I justified because I worked my 2 weeks, and I shouldn't have to work for him because he is definitely an asshole. \\n\\nP.S. I'm 16 and he's like 30   \n",

                             I'm in education, a senior at university. Recently I was placed for this semester after asking for \"something within a couple miles\" of the university (since I'd have to commute on foot).\\n\\nUnfortunately, they placed me in a relatively high-crime neighborhood which is known (among my generation, not so much those above it) as a place not to be around after 3pm (especially around the local high school...which is exactly where and when I'd be).\\n\\nI'm a scrawny white guy, and for the record the neighborhood *is* primarily nonwhite- not that this matters; I've worked in primarily nonwhite communities before and had zero issue.\\n\\nHere's how the conversation went:\\n\\n&gt;School: Your Fall 2016 fieldwork placement will be in the [redacted] school district for your observation hours. Someone in the district will be contacting you soon with the information of where and with whom specifically you will be working with.\\n\\n&gt;Me:  are there any options that, given that I stated I have to travel there on foot, are a) closer, and/or b) NOT in such a bad neighborhood?\\n\\n&gt;I hate to be picky, but most people who live around here know not to be in [town] around when school lets out. And I'm primarily concerned with my own safety here.\\n\\n&gt;School: I am here to provide you with directions which will allow you to take public transportation to get to the schools in [town] school district. I hope that, following your experience in [town] school district, along with guided reflection from Professor [name], you will have a matured professionalism in regards to working with high-needs adolescents.  Until then, please know that it is my responsibility to ensure that all teacher candidates have clinical practice in a diverse array of school settings according to NYSED requirements.\\n\\n&gt;Me: Fair enough. I hope that you did not take my concern as a racially motivated one, but rather one motivated by statistics and personal experience. Had [nice black neighborhood] experienced the same issues when I was placed there previously, I would have voiced similar concerns.\\n\\nI grew up in Queens, so I'm not exactly soft. But this school has been known to have racial and gang-related incidents in the (fairly recent!!!) past. I'm not a racist- but I'm not a moron either.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?\\n\\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I'm 21 years old and am *still* mistaken for a high (or even middle!) schooler by pretty much everyone.   \n",

It's a lot of fun. Anyways, there's this girl who is very very sheltered. And any time someone curses or says something obscene, she lectures them.\\n\\nAnyhow, I accidentally hurt myself while building a robot and naturally I said \"shit\". She promptly says \"you shouldn't say that, that's a bad word\". This girl is 16 and I'm 17 for reference. I just was kinda frustrated with her and was like \"you're in highschool, how are you not used to this?\"\\n\\nWas this a dick move? If so, please let me know how to handle it. She won't even let me say piss. And it's pissing me off   \n",

                                                                                                                       I'm 18, just recently graduated High School, and I haven't started work nor college yet (Work starts this week.) He's 16, and I love him, but we oftentimes have it out verbally. \\n\\nWhat usually ends up happening is that we'll go a week or two getting along, and then he does something or gets an attitude about something that absolutely drives me mad. Then, inevitably; we end up fighting about it.\\n\\nHalf the time I feel that I'm not in the wrong. What usually incites these arguments is the fact that I tell him what to do, even when my parents end up saying the same thing I do in the long run. No matter what it is, if it comes out of my mouth he's going to have an attitude about it.\\n\\nWithin the past 2 days, we recently had to mow. I usually do a good bulk of the mowing, and he gets the trim. That's how it's been for a long time and it works well with both of our schedules. So I let him know that the mowing needs done (Yesterday) and he goes out to do it. Instead of mowing the trim however, he mows over everything I already did; saying it wasn't done (Even though you could very clearly see the difference of what was done and what wasn't.) I confronted him about it (Calmly mind you.) and he goes off and gives me his attitude as per the norm. Things obviously verbally escalate, and he tells me to leave (Even though I was calm the entire time.) And I know if I left, nothing would be done about it.\\n\\nFlash forward to today, and he made himself some lunch (School's out for today.) He always has a problem with making sure he gets his dirty dishes inside the dishwasher, and he usually leaves his messes for someone else to clean up. Today is my mother's birthday, and in knowing this; I knew she would be absolutely livid if she saw the mess he made. I went to his room (Again, calmly) To tell him to clean up his mess, and to do so very quickly. If either of my parents would see the mess he made of the kitchen, they would be pissed. And I didn't want them to get mad on my mother's birthday, and I didn't want to clean his mess up for him because he needs to learn to do it on his own.\\n\\nI go out to get a snack as he's cleaning, and I told him how we get along for a week or so and he becomes an insufferable douche. Then he tells me that he can't wait until I move out, even though it probably won't happen and he called me a fat ass with a superiority complex. All because I told him to clean up his mess, and mow his part of the lawn (Which hasn't even been done yet.)\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: Thank you so far for the feedback! I'll definitely try and tone down how much I tell him what to do.\\nI would like to mention/ask a few things however. I'm not looking to change minds, I genuinely want help.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter whether or not you ask him kindly to do something or tell him. A majority of the time he will get huffy about it. Even with my parents.\\n\\nThe only one he doesn't seem to have a problem listening to is our oldest brother (21). And they never fight whenever he tells him to do something, and he even agrees that I'm usually right on most matters.\\n\\nIs there any way for me to ensure that he'll start cleaning up after himself without sounding bossy? Or for my parents to do so? I don't want them to have to clean up after him, nor do I think I should have to either.\\n\\nOnce again, thank you for the responses! I'll keep them in mind next time a think a confrontation might happen. I'll definitely try to ask him instead of tell him more often, and I won't pester him about his chores as much.

few months. I have a place to stay and all that. I've tried to discuss this with my parents so I'm not just walking out the door one day, but they refuse to listen. They like to pretend it's not happening. I'm the oldest sibling, so I understand that cutting the cord must be hard. But it's bound to happen eventually.\\n\\nI had posted on Facebook that I was at a bar near where I'd be moving to. A friend of mine commented saying I was minutes away from her house. I responded saying I'll be moving down there in a few months and we can hangout and whatnot. This was posted last night.\\n\\nThis morning I wake up to a text from my mom saying that before I go posting things like that on Facebook I should talk to her and dad first. I responded saying that I've tried and they won't listen. I know when I get home later today they'll want to have a discussion about how I need to watch what I post online and blah blah blah (I'm 21 for god's sake. I make an innocent joke about Ted Cruz awhile ago and my mom gave me a long chat about that).\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like at my age, and the fact that I pay all of my own bills already (insurance, car, phone. Everything except medical.) should be grounds that I can move out basically whenever I want. Am I wrong?   \n",

My boyfriend hates unnatural hair colors and while he says he'll love me regardless he thinks it looks trashy and he is gonna be bummed out if I dye it. I think I'm gonna do it anyway. Am I an asshole?**\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half now. He's loving, caring blah blah blah. We have a great relationship with some minor conflict, but everything has been getting better (he grew up in a shitty household and this is his first real long term relationship, so he's kinda learning how a healthy relationship works). He's 25 and I'm 21.\\n\\nWhen I go through periods of stress I usually get myself a big \"gift\", usually something that is a big change. I'm in college so generally this is once a semester. Last semester I got a cat, the semester before that I got a pet snake, the one before that I went platinum blonde and the one before that I dyed my hair red. For some reason it helps me cope with stress. \\n\\nSo it's getting to that time again and I figured my \"gift\" this semester would be dying my hair some crazy colors. I've always wanted to do that and I feel like if I do it I need to do it soon since I probably won't be able to after graduation because I'll have a job (or at least be seeking one). I've been floating the idea past my boyfriend for a few months but yesterday I asked him in earnest to tell me what he thought. I sent a few pictures of styles I liked for his opinion and he confessed that he hated unnatural hair dyes, thought they looked trashy and that he really couldn't see himself liking any hair dye on me because he likes my natural color. \\n\\nI even tried photoshopping some different hair colors on a picture of me to see if that would change his mind (and because it was fun) but he still hated it. He told me I could do what I want, that he would still love me but that he prefers my natural hair and mentioned that if I had an appearance preference for him, he would do it. He told me he would still support me regardless and that it's my body to do what I want with, he was just gonna hate the way it looked.\\n\\nInitially I figured I would just not dye it and that would be that, but I'm having a really hard time giving up on the idea and I feel like I'll regret it later if I don't go a little crazy now while I have the chance. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just do it anyway but I feel shitty. I know if he wanted to do something like buzz his hair that I wouldn't like I'd be kinda disappointed too, I don't blame him at all for that. But does doing it anyway make me an asshole?   \n",

situation.\\n\\n\\n\\nYesterday at work, me and my small group of work friends were having lunch. My (F26 white non-religious) good friend (F26 white non-religious) started going off about how much she hates Christmas, because it's racist and exclusive and unfair, et cetera. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I do not think Christmas is racist. I will admit that it's unfair that most Christian holidays are Canada's federal holidays, but whatareyougonnado. Really I think no religious holidays should be federal holidays, and we should just get extra Vacation time in lieu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso worth noting that I am really trying to get into the Christmas \"spirit\" because of how dark and dreary the days are getting. I mainly see Christmas as a celebration with lights and decorations and being with those you love. My bf and I have planned a week long holiday to New York for Christmas and I'm very excited. She knows all this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis isn't the first time in the last couple weeks that she's ranted a little about Christmas' racism and exclusion. Over the weekend, I had sent her a bunch of pictures of my cat in a cute reindeer sweater. She had responded positively with \"CHRISTMAS BABY!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo when she was ranting I smiled and was like \"haha, you can't hate Christmas thaaaaat much when my kitties are so cute in their Christmas sweaters!\" she kind of laughed and was like \"yeah, no I hate Christmas.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOk, fine, whatever. I didn't think anything of it. It didn't feel like a negative interaction to me. But I guess I really struck a nerve, because about an hour later she sent me an instant message basically saying \"I can hate Christmas and all the racist things about it and still like pictures of cats,\" but longer. I couldn't think of anything to say so I just didn't reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike, ok? Yes? Of course you can? I was just teasing... It wasn't like I was roasting her loudly in front of all our friends, it was just a quiet smiling prod, like we do sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, she hasn't talked to me since. I'm hesitant to say anything as I feel alienated. AITA?\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

I was raised in the Mormon church, but mentally left at 14.  I told my parents how I felt at 16 and it did not go well; they said I was deceived by Satan and corrupting my younger siblings etc.  It is only recently that they have allowed me to not come with them to Church on Sundays, which was a major source of anxiety for me.\\n\\nHowever, my parents want me to come with them on Christmas Day.  I don't know anyone in this new ward and I don't want to give them the idea that I'm interested in coming back or whatever.  Also, I struggle with anxiety and don't think I could handle being going, even just for Christmas.  I have tried explaining this to them and they either don't take me seriously or mock me for it.  Am I the asshole?   \n",

I live at home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and younger sister.\\n\\nThe hours my team and I play are between 6pm and 12am every night, although not for 6 hours continuously; it may be 9pm till 12am, or 6pm till 10pm, etc. and obviously I'm talking during those hours. Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\\n\\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\\n\\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this, all because I game competitively and am trying to win money from winning events?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm a college student. My first roommate dropped out in October, and I got a new one to start he 2nd semester. He's the worst. Here's some of the undesirable qualities about him.\\n\\n* Incredible snoring. I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven't approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was \"have you told him about your snoring??\" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It's too loud not to know. This is fine, you can't help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I'm not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point...\\n\\n* He's a lazy fuck. He's very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it's because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn't do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn't help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality..\\n* He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn't stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a \"stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3\". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn't even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it.\\n\\nTonight though, I thought about something. I am talking about him a lot. I mean, he gives me a lot to talk about. However, I feel like I may be just as bad as he is, talking about him and the things he does with my friends and floormates behind his back. So, am I the asshole? Am I the asshole for talking about him so much and making such a big deal out of him, or is he simply the asshole and I'm responding to that?\\n</td>\n",

After I met her, I told my son (let's call him Tyler) that I thought Katie* was really sweet and smart and looked like she liked to eat.  Ok, I know that sounds bad, but Tyler's previous gf Dakota was borderline and refused to eat in front of anyone, and it always bothered me. I mean, if Tyler invites you over for a holiday meal, at least sit at the table and play with your food.  I guarantee no one would notice, but they will notice you sitting on the couch sulking.\\n\\nBut I digress, and I had to, to make the rest make sense.  About a year later, Tyler and Katie were hanging out here and he tells her what I said.  She looked kind of upset, and I know she thought I was making a comment about her weight, but I swear I wasn't.  I explained the whole Dakota situation, which she should've understood because she knew her and hated her with a passion.  I apologized, and explained what I meant.  I thought we were good.\\n\\nCut to **three** months later.  I'm at work and get a text from Katie's mom:  \"You're a fucking bully!  How dare you talk to an 18-year-old child like that.  You told my daughter she was a fat pig!\"\\n\\nWhat?  She texts back:  \"You're a sad pathetic cunt picking on a child.\"  This goes on and on.  I mean, I thought we were friends.  This literally came out of fucking nowhere!\\n\\nI tried to explain that I love to cook, and I love when people come over and they like to eat.  I really don't give a shit that the girl weighed 200 pounds.  Whatever.  My son loved her, so I loved her.\\n\\nSo am I an asshole for saying a girl looks like she likes to eat?\\n\\nEdit:  I forgot to mention that later on Katie's mom said she'd call the cops because I was harassing her.  I was ignoring most of her texts but at that point I texted her my address and said please, call the police.  Needless to say, she didn't.</td>\n",

He freaks out and gets mad that I didn't bring him along. I said that he should chill and that I just didn't think of it. He said he's afraid that I'm leaving him, which honestly might be true. I don't want to completely leave him behind, but if it comes down to it I know I will. I told him that he needs to chill in social situations and try to curb the random shit he says or I won't be able to hang out with him anymore.

The divorce has been very \"messy\" with my parents constantly putting me and my 17 year old brother in the middle. Both my brother and I live with my mom and see my dad a few times a week. \\n\\nBoth my mom and I work at a hardware store together. My dad came in yesterday, like he usually does every now and then, looking at some clearance items in flooring and decided he wanted to buy some plus order some more. I told him I'd handle it all and call him later. I was told to put his items aside in the back and called him when I left work to let him know. He said he and his girlfriend would come in later that night to make sure she liked everything my dad was planning to purchase. \\n\\nMy mom was working at that time so I texted her letting her know they were coming to give her a heads up. Later my mom freaked out saying I shouldn't have brought him to the store, although he came by himself, and I shouldn't help him because of the way he treats her and she let everyone at work know that I don't live with him so if I let him use my discount I would be fired. She also threatened to not come home that night, but she eventually did really late.\\n\\nWe've been going back and forth all day. She thinks I should have told my dad not to bring his girlfriend in. My dad isn't a reasonable person so I don't think he'd listen, and I really dont see how I'm supposed to control what he does. I'm also upset that she blames this whole thing on me when it seems like it's a problem between them. I'm also not happy about her airing out our dirty laundry for all our employees to see and also threatening my job.\\n\\nI'm sorry this is so long but if anyone has actually read all of this and would like to offer an opinion it'd be greatly appreciated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will try to provide as much context as possible to present the story in an unbiased way.\\n\\nI come from a very conservative Christian family that raised me up through private school with the sole intention of me going to a 4 year college. I have always known that this is not the career path that I wanted to take, but in fear of disappointing them, I never told them and ended up actually attending a semester at a very nice college with the hope that it would grow on me. It only made me even more sure of my decision to quit and go into a field that only requires specific training. My mom was understanding and more supportive than my dad, who has never been the same since. Everything up to this point only serves as contet for the actual altercation. \\n\\nI was 18 when this happened. I had been home for a couple of months and searching for a part-time job by my parents' demand. I was sending out dozens of applications, but my complete lack of prior experience was making it difficult to even get a call back. One day my dad gets home from buying pool chemicals and tells me that they had a help wanted sign on the door and for me to apply online for it immediately. I didn't have a problem with this, so I went to the website to check the listing. It was a 21+ management position. Later, he asked me if I applied, and I told him that I was underage and not qualified so I didn't bother. This made him very angry, telling me that I would do what he said and to send in the application anyway. I repeated that I was 18 and have never had a real job before, much less a management position. We argued back and forth with the same thing for a bit and it eventually came to him saying \"I'll just apply for you. Give me your resume and be quiet.\" I said \"I don't have one, so you'll be sending in nothing,\" to which he replied \"Don't be a smart ass.\"\\n\\nA little more context to go with the first bit: I had heard my father curse only once before this, and it was after a severe injury, so this marked a serious escalation in the seriousness of situation where my family is concerned. The tone he used in saying this was very agressive and threatening, so my 18 year old reaction was that I wasn't going to take verbal abuse from anyone, so I said \"Was the language supposed to drive the point across harder?\"\\n\\nAnd this broke him. He got up from his chair and started walking toward me saying \"How about I beat your ass right now?\" My adrenaline replied \"Do you want to try?\" At this point my mom ran in screaming at my dad to stop, and he backed away from me but continued to the heart of what he was going to say. As best I remember it, he said \"I'm sick of your fucking bull shit and I'm sick of you. I pay out the ass for your school your entire life and you thank me by dropping out of college after one semester and pursuing a white trash job. You're an ungrateful little shit and it makes me want to leave this house.\" And then he stormed off. \\n\\nNow to the present, I'm still at home finishing up mechanic's school, and our relationship is still very awkward. We rarely speak. My mom has always sided with me on this situation, reminding me that his mother was severely bipolar and his father killed himself, so he probably inherited a mental illness and to not take what he says too personally.\\n\\nThe way I see it is that there were many times in the fight where either of us could have ended it more peacefully, but in the end it comes down to my dad not being supportive of my career choice and selfishly wanting me to do what he wants me to do.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n</td>\n",

My parents divorced early and I lived with my mom from 6-13 in Ohio, whereas I had been in Texas before. Anyway, When I was 13, I came home from school one day and my mom had been arrested for like the 5th time for doing drugs. But this time was permanent. (I haven't seen her since.)\\n\\nAfter that, my grandma drove up to Ohio from Texas to get me, and brought my dad with her. Then we drove back, and I moved in with my grandma. My grandma is awesome. Anyway, I found out shortly after moving in that my uncle would also be living with my grandma. My uncle is 40. He has \"mental problems\" as my grandparents describe it, so they use that as an excuse to put up with his bs, such as leaving messes everywhere, trashes my grandmas car, never having a job, and they said he will probably never move out because is isn't capable.\\n\\nSo that went on for about 2 years, and oh man I hated it. His blatant disrespect for how lucky he was made me so angry. He was practically sucking financial resources out of my grandparents for free because he was lazy. Two years of rent free life. That combined with the fact that he is an enormous jerk really makes me hate him.\\n\\nAfter those 2 years, my grandma brings up that my dad, back in Dallas (I live in a very small town about an hour away) has been living on the streets long enough, so she lets HIM move in as well. When HE moves in, he does the same thing as my uncle. Freeloading, whining, being ungrateful, and just generally being a drain and a pain in the ass.\\n\\nHaving to live with these two constantly makes me dread being home. It has made me really sour. I literally never smile when they are around, and I never speak to them. When they speak to me I just answer with quick one word answers and try to end the conversation as quickly as possible. My uncle still lives here, going on nearly 4 years (I'm 16.). My dad has been here for about 3 months, but he is no closer to moving out than he was when he got here. I am constantly reassured he will be gone as soon as he gets his first paycheck, but he doesn't have a job and I'm not holding my breathe. My grandma knows I am super unhappy with them being here, but she and my sister both say I am being a dick. They say that my dad and uncle are family, and I shouldn't hate them, that I should give them more chances.\\n\\nSince my entire life all of my family, besides my little sister and grandparents, have been drug addicts, failures, and freeloaders, I never really learned to value family. I just don't feel it. But I do feel intense anger towards both of these gents.\\n\\nSo there you go, reddit. Am I justified? Am I being unreasonable?</td>\n",

What's going on with you?\" 27 times at a barking dog that would be on the other side of the room while people are directly looking at him, and doing the opposite of what you tell him to do (he always serves my mom an excessive amount of food, even though she always says that she does not want any more).\\n\\n\\nEither way, we've gotten into more and more arguments, and I don't know if he's being the asshole, or if I am.

We don't have the same interests, the only time we speak is if something needs to be done or if a question needs to be answered, and just never really spent time together as I was growing up unless we were forced to (family vacation, ect).

His younger sister, Gretchen, had a few friends over as well but since they were juniors in high school at the time and we were in college, they weren't around us most of the night. I am pretty  drunk by the end of the night, and Gretchen's best friend Lola decided to ditch her young friends and join the partying college kids. Lola and I hit it off, and we are talking for a long period of time. She shows me her tattoo, we talk about how hard it is to find jeans that fit properly (we are both quite tall), the whole bit. I wake up the next morning and Lola is gone, and I was kinda disappointed. \\n\\nI get a text from Gretchen saying that Lola wants my number, she was just too nervous to ask for it the night before. I oblige, and we start texting. She starts getting very serious about things and wants to hang out really bad and asks how serious we are and where this is going (which I am fine with, and I find very attractive actually)I am then informed that she is only 16 years old, and I realize that a relationship isn't going to work if I have to go back for spring semester in a week. And even after that, she's still in another year of high school. So I tell her that unfortunately I can't do the long distance thing, especially from college to high school. We are at different points in our lives and have different priorities. She is extremely understanding, and very cool about it. Then a few weeks later, she texts me and asks to hang out one weekend that I'm home. I politely decline and say something would happen between us, and then I would have to leave again for school and it would be too hard. She says, and I quote,\\n\\n \"pantherlax56 I'm not trying to start a relationship, I just want to hang out with you.\"\\n\\nI again politely decline the offer. She texts me intermittently after that, and I say maybe we can get together over the summer when I'm home for while. She says that sounds good. The texting pretty much cuts off a few days later.\\n\\nFast forward to the summer. Im home from school, and I'm ready to party with my friends I haven't seen in awhile. So my other friend, Richard, invites me over to his house for some beers. We watch F1 qualifying, and start talking about girls. As it happens, Richard and Lola are good friends. He tells me that she has been talking about me non stop, and he repeatedly told her \\n\\n\"you guys will be a thing over the summer just wait\"\\n\\n because he couldn't deal with her constant mentions of me. We're both pretty drunk, and he says, \\n\\n\"hey dude, its Lola's birthday today. If you wanna make someone's day, text her.\"\\n\\n So I do. We pretty much pick up right where we left off and things start getting hot and heavy pretty quick. We start making sexual innuendos on a daily basis, talking about \"studying extra hard\" for her finals and making sure she's \"extra prepared\" for her male reproductive system test (she's in nursing classes). I think to myself: \\n\\n1. I expressed my feelings about a relationship awhile ago, and she understood\\n2. She told me she didn't want a relationship either, just to hang out\\n3. We are talking very sexually within days of talking to each other for the first time in months\\n\\nAnd I conclude that we both want a casual hookup FWB type thing. So I ask to hang out, she says sure. I ask if we can hang out at her place, she says there is \"nowhere to go\" (furthering my assumptions of a casual sex thing). So I say she can come over to my house and we can \"study.\" She says sounds great. She comes over, we have sex, she goes home. I get a text from Lola that says, \\n\\n\"so what does this mean?\" \\n\\nand I ask, \\n\\n\"what do you mean, what does this mean?\"\\n\\n\"are we casual or is this going anywhere?\" she asks.\\n\\nI explain that I made an assumption based on what I thought were obvious clues, and I apologize, but my feelings about having a relationship with someone far away and still in high school haven't changed in 2 months. I apologize profusely, and reiterate the fact that we already talked about not being in a relationship and just hanging out. I thought I knew what that meant, but I was wrong. She gets very upset, and doesn't talk to me.\\n\\nI have now come to find out that Lola explained (in graphic detail) what her and I did to Jeremy and Gretchen's parents. My best friend's mother apparently said that I \"hit it and quit it.\" So the next time I was over at Jeremy's, it was terribly awkward because Lola, Gretchen, and Jeremy's parents were all there. Everyone knew that we had sex, and then just quit talking. \\n\\nLola hates me, Gretchen thinks I'm a \"fuckboi\", and her parents think I intentionally \"hit it and quit it.\"\\n\\nAm I an asshole for assuming what I did?\\n\\nEDIT: I left  a few things out of the original story in the interest of keeping it short. When we met, I was 18, she was 16. When we had sex, we were both a year older (19 and 17 respectively). I didn't just cease communication with her as soon as I pulled out, as some seem to think. I simply meant that it was very awkward between us due to the miscommunication, and she made it clear that she didn't want anything to do with me anymore. \\n\\nAlso, if I could defend myself a bit: Sex is an act that involves at least two people. If she didn't want to, she could have said/let on that she wasn't into it. But I know that she wanted to, because she initiated it physically. I won't get into the gory details but she definitely started and continued to enable the act of foreplay/intercourse. This was also the first time we hung out in person, just the two of us. I don't know about you all, but if I plan on starting a relationship with someone, I probably wouldn't have sex with them on the first \"date\" or whatever you might call our little hangout mesh.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I would like to clarify that 16 is the age of consent in my state. Regardless of your moral standings, I am in the clear legally. Also remember that she was 17, only 2 years younger than me at the time.</td>\n",

However, what I do mind, is when I give them the receipt from my trip, which contains all THEY wanted(if I get anything for me, I do it on a seperate transaction as to not add confusion to the bill).

The thing is, I wouldn't mind if these were just snide comments, but these turn into days long arguments over something like $11.

       "      <td>So I'll refer to my friend as Chris. Me and Chris have been friends for 6years, I'm 19 right now. We originally met in school when we were 13-14 years old. Back then like most boys, we did nothing but play a lot of videogames. We weren't your stereotypical Urkle-type nerd, but more the quiet bunch that played a lot of games and got along with nearly everyone. \\n\\nChris and me were part of a bigger group of 'core' friends. But since Chris and me had been classmates we knew eachother very well. I considered him one of my best friends.\\n\\nBack then I was out of shape aswell, needless to say me and Chris were really good friends and not the most popular in the school. As a kid with low confidence going through puberty, I 'dealt' with normal adolescent insecurities by being the nice guy. ( ~~sometimes to a fault when i look back at things~~ , definitely to a fault, I would let other people push me around )\\n\\n\\nDuring the next two years in school, I, then Chris respectivelly flunked a year in school. Because of this we ended up in different classes, and made different friends. I mostly hung out with my 'core' group, Chris more and more with a new group of friends. We were 16 at the time, still very good friends but hanging out less because of different friend groups. Soon after Chris made his new friends, he became attractive and popular. ( And more dickisch in my opinion )\\n\\nChris would never have time to hang out with me or any other friends from the original 'core' group anymore, since making new friends. This didn't bother me too much, people made new friends all the time during adolescence. \\n\\nI only started getting annoyed with Chris not having the time to hang out with me, when 2-3times a month he would show up to my place after school to drop of his stuff, so he wouldn't have to lugg it around when hanging out with his friends. I voiced once that I didn't like it that he would use my house as his personal locker, but let myself get pushed over since i was too timid and friendly. This went on untill we were about 18. \\n\\n\\nWhen we bothe started uni, Chris said he would have more time to hang out with his old friends now, since he wouldn't be able to see most of his then current friends. ( This always felt a bit fake to me, since it felt to me like our 'core' group got labelled as a plan B, for when plan A wasn't available )\\n\\nNow I'm a different person compared to when I was 13-16. I started lifting weights, grew till I was 1.88/6\"2, My 'face' had become attractive aswell. I started kickboxing aswell. All these things grew me a lot of confidence.\\n\\nThe straw that tipped the bucket... So me and some friends of the old 'core' group were hanging out at a quiet field with a nice view. Chris showed up aswell. ( Occasionally we'd meet when going out drinking/partying in town ). \\n\\n\\nWe sat in a cirkle and I was seated next to Chris. Chris started smoking and because of the direction of the wind, his smoke ended up in my face all the time. I stated this and asked him to either move, or stop smoking. He kinda ignored me and continued anyway. I sat in the grass for another 8ish seconds not really knowing how to make him stop since he wouldn't listen to me. So i pushed him. (We were bothe sitting in the grass next to eachother, this was more a one-armed light shoulder push then a full rage sparta push). Chris just laughed this off, and continued smoking again, he said that the only reason he let the smoke get in my face was because i reacted to it. Even though I didn't feel like I should have had to deal with this shit, I kept my mouth shut for another 15ish seconds whilst Chris continued to keep smoking. My other friends (and I guess Chris aswell) didn't really notice how serious I was with being annoyed with having constant smoke in my face. Well, I bursted, I stood up, yelled at Chris, called him out for all his shit, took my bike and left while my other friends were trying to calm me down.\\n\\nI guess the reason I'm mad at Chris is because he never respected me once he became popular, He would use me as a friend for when he needed one. \\n\\nEven after I became known as the attractive guy in my auditorium, he still wouldn't respect me. I always felt like he looked down on me as a friend. The worst part of this might be that I'm a confident guy, but I feel like a turn into a bitch whenever i stand across from Chris. Like I don't really care what people think off me, or wheter they 'respect' me or not. But for some reason I do with Chris, and I can't get over it. I feel like an idiot just being able to get so mad and even typing a whole story like this over something that is so trivial in my life. \\n\\nSo... Am I the asshole for yelling at Chris (because I guess i'm insecure when it comes to him) or is Chris the Asshole.\\n \\nTLDR: used to be an quiet, friendly, low selfesteem type kid. Had a very good friend who turned popular, and I feel like he 'used' and pushed me around as a friend, without ever standing up to him because of my low self esteem. We sort of parted ways naturally through school. By now I had become confident and popular myself. Was hanging out with some people including that particular 'friend'. He blew smoke in my face and wouldn't stop. I felt disrespected too much, and called him out on his shit.\\n\\n</td>\n",

I also had a friend that I've known for 15 years, and my father and his were best friends. Well, fast forward a couple years after I didn't have that 3 way because I ended up getting black out drunk at the college she went to and forgot about them, and she's engaged to my childhood friend, and she's pregnant. Now I'm a pretty liberal guy, and very open minded. She's very conservative. We're friends on Facebook and she posts shit saying Obama should be impeached and things like that, and I always like the cnn article of 182 things obama has done, and each one has citation. But then today she posted a picture saying something along the lines of marriage isn't about religion, or finances, and it's only about love. Then I posted something along the lines of saying it's wrong of her to sit there and say someone getting married because it's part of their religion, or making it a financial decision is wrong when she expects others to be tolerant of her views on it. She then proceeded to threaten me, and attack me personally. Which I ignored the personal attacks, and the threat because of my respect for my old friend. Then before I respond she tags him in it, and he calls me a douche for calling her on her shit. I responded by saying that I was happy for them (I'm not, she's a bitch and a slut) but that if she expects others to be open to her ideas about marriage she has to be open to others. She then threatened me again, and attacked me saying that my father didn't want me and I'm a failure. I don't talk to my dad by choice, and while I recently quit my job I have no debt, an she has student loans for a degree she didn't finish, and no job. I didn't say any of that though, nor did I post any of the pictures of her I have, nor did I tell him about the tumblr page she used to have that I got those pictures off of. What I did tell her is to thank him that I'm not going to flip out on her, and I blocked her. Then I messaged him saying I'm sorry things had to go down like that, and blocked him.\\n\\nPS I haven't talked to my dad in over a year and haven't seen him in about 2 and a half. He wasn't there growing up, and so me and this friend weren't best friends, but we were still friends.\\n\\nTL;DR Oldest friends slutty fiance doesn't like me, and we got into it.

If anything is unclear please let me know and I'll try to clarify.\\n\\nI am 23 years old, recently graduated from college, and currently living with my mother on the East Coast (USA). If it matters my parents are divorced and I am not living under my father's roof. Recently my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together in California. This is a good move for me career-wise because I want to work in the biotech/pharma industry.\\n\\nI ask my father for advice frequently but he also gives a lot of unsolicited advice. He says that this is because he has an analytical problem-solving nature that he can't shut off. He  thinks that I need to have interviews lined up in CA before moving there, otherwise I will drain my savings.\\n\\nIdeally I'd love to have interviews lined up before moving but I personally don't think it's realistic. Companies often don't take applicants seriously if their address is on the other side of the country. I did apply to a lot of CA jobs during spring and never heard back from any of them. I was afraid that if I applied to more with my East Coast address it would be a waste. My father then suggested I put down an address of someone I know in CA, but I'd have to be able to fly down for interviews on short notice, which would also drain my savings.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I picked out a short-term lease apartment and he is willing to cover rent and other costs of living until I am employed. We made a budget. I have $8000 in savings that will be used on the security deposit and my plane ticket. The rest will be emergency funds. I do not expect my father to bail me out financially under any circumstances. I am not moving to CA for around a month, but I have started applying to jobs using the apartment's address. My father wanted me to have interviews lined up before choosing an apartment.\\n\\nI fully explained my reasoning to my father and I can explain more of my reasoning if anyone asks. I do understand my father's concerns and I know he's trying to look out for me. I told him that I took time to think on his advice but I am not going to follow it and I would like to stop discussing it. He got angry and told me that was a very disrespectful thing for me to say.\\n\\nMy father thinks I was just too lazy to apply for jobs early because people in my generation have lazy attitudes. He said he felt it was his duty to \"slap that attitude in the face\". I found this very hurtful because I'd applied to tons of East Coast jobs before deciding to move to CA, so I'm clearly not too lazy to apply to jobs. At this point both of us were raising our voices. \\n\\nAt 9:40 during the argument I told him I needed to leave soon to feed cats I was pet sitting by 10:00. He wouldn't drop the argument and I reminded him I needed to leave several times. The cats have special diets and need medicine, so by 10:40 I walked away from the argument, telling him I was already 40 minutes late to feed them. This is especially where I'm worried I was the asshole. But in my opinion it's definitely an asshole move to not feed the cats.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I told my father that when he gives me unsolicited advice I will always listen and consider it. But if I end up choosing not to follow his advice I want him to respect my decision. His response was that this is very disrespectful to him. I ended up walking out mid-argument because I was pet sitting cats with special dietary needs and was already 40 minutes late to feed them. My father was aware that I had this responsibility. I am 23, not living under my father's roof, and not depending on him financially. AITA for choosing not to follow his advice and/or leaving the argument to feed the cats?</td>\n",

I have been living peacefully on the first floor for about two months until recently a single mother with three bad ass kids around the ages of six moved into the apartment directly above me. For approximately a week, the kids sound like they are intentionally trying to annoy the hell out of me by stomping around like apes. If you have ever had someone live above you, multiply the noise by ten and now you feel my pain. I have tried talking to the mother and explain to her how to control her kids, but that just seem to piss her off. Never tell a mother she is a bad parent, now it seems that it's non-stop play time for her kids. Little does she know I have a 1000W 5.1 surround sound system that I have not put to good use since the move to these apartments. A day later, I cranked up the music about midday, it made the water in my glass vibrate, so i'm sure she enjoyed the booming bass just as much as I. That went on for half an hour or so before I judged she had enough. For the rest of  the day I was able to read my Game of Thrones in silence, but to my disbelief, the next morning was hell. I could literally hear the mother tell her children to play football inside because it was too hot outside. Really bitch? I had to take it to the next level. The blasting of my music lasted for hours at a time during the day, I even gave her a taste of it around five in the morning. I can tell you she did not love that by the banging on my door about 20 minutes later. I told her I like to get pumped before my morning runs. She cursed and purposely stomped back upstairs to her zoo that she called home. Later that day I continued my music festival in my living room for about 2 more hours. It seems she has forfeited and began to settle her children down, but just to make sure I have continued the blasting of music just to put the nail in the coffin. Am I the Asshole?</td>\n",

The next morning (Friday), I called the payroll office and what they told me is that my account number was denied and that the credit card my money was on was a student account that was made for me (I was never told about this until then). So I set up my direct deposit again and the lady on the phone told me that the two account numbers were different (Being the one before it got declined and the one i just entered) I checked what I just put in and it was correct. After I got off the phone, I called my bank and got on the phone with an extremely rude women who kept interrupting me and telling me I wasn't making sense. I was told to call back on Monday. Today is Wednesday. I got my other card with my money on it (thank god) and my direct deposit is good to go. However, I just got another email from the payroll office telling me AGAIN that the reason they canceled my information, was because my account number was wrong. I'm sorry if I didn't explain it before because i'm ranting, but the problem I have is, why did I get paid on my debit card the first week if my information was invalid? I was stuck between whether or not the payroll office or the bank messed up. I am leaning towards the fact that the payroll office messed up and just canceled my information for some stupid reason, causing all of these problems. I have been getting countless emails about it and I'm starting to get sick of it. I am about to call them and complain because it is absolutely ridiculous. Am I the asshole for wanting to call them back because they have been messing with my shit?\\n\\ntl;dr Am I the asshole for wanting to complain to my payroll office for fucking up my pay. \\n\\n\\nEdit: Ended up not calling. Figured I would just let it go cause there's not use in getting mad when it's all over.</td>\n",

I've come to the realization that I was raised very differently then them when it comes to family. They (Kelly and Austin) we're raised in big family oriented households and so every friend that they had in their lives met the whole of their respective families fairly soon. I however was not raised in such a family oriented way, I never had any friends meet my family unless it was absolutely necessary (going out of town, having a sleepover or what have you, things that required a parent or guardian to be aware of what was happening). Anyway a few weeks ago somehow meeting my now, Kelly and Austin have still never met my family but about a week ago it got brought up and I said I didn't want them to meet because it wasn't necessary. That's not to say they have no way to contact my family, I've given my friends my parents' phone numbers in case of an emergency and vice versa they want to meet and be incorporated into my family. I have met and get along famously with both of their families but then it wasn't really my choice to meet them it was just sort of a last minute thing. I don't really have any reasons for my friends to not meet my family other than it's not necessary or that the parties involved wouldn't mesh like I do with my friends it would be more like saying hello to someone in an office, nothing really there just a social obligation to be nice.

I texted my friend - let's call him Nate - asking if he wanted to hang out. Sure, and he proposes that we go hang out with my ex - who we'll call Abby - and her friend - Jane works. I said \"No\" because I knew it would be awkward for pretty much everyone. Nate and I agree we'll hang out at my house for a bit, and then figure out something to do.\\n\\nI go and pick him up from his house, and as we're driving back to my house, Abby calls him and says she and Jane are buying ice cream from dairy queen and asks if we want any. Nate immediately says \"I'll have a Reese's and Josh will have a chocolate.\" He didn't actually ask me. I tell him I don't want anything. He offers to pay, and it's not worth arguing, so I turn around and start driving to Dairy Queen.\\n\\nWell, they were actually 45 minutes away at a different dairy queen. I drive there, just to not leave them there.\\n\\nWhen we get there, Nate bails, and says he was kidding about paying for me. I pay up, but he knows I'm starting to get annoyed.\\n\\nWe then go into a Target to kill time. It was awkward. Very awkward. Abby and I didn't really talk and it was a lot of silence. I didn't have a good time, and I told Nate, \"I wanna just go hang out with some other friends or at least go back to my house. This isn't fun at all for me. It sucks.\" He says \"Okay, we'll go to your house once we leave.\"\\n\\n15 minutes later as were walking out, Nate gets the idea in everyone's heads we should go play laser tag. I groan and give him an evil eye. \"It'll be fun. I promise it'll be quick.\"\\n\\nWe go to this place - I'll just call it the arcade - that has bowling, arcade games, laser tag, a ropes course, and an assortment of other things. We agree to just play a quick game of laser tag before hand. When we walk in, Jane says we should buy the unlimited pass and do a bunch of stuff. The unlimited pass is $25. They all now want to buy the unlimited pass, and Nate is trying to convince me to pay for Abby, and he'll pay for Jane. I say no, and convince them to just do the one laser tag game. I go up and buy my ticket first. The three of them... go up and buy unlimited passes even though they said they'd do just the laser tag game.\\n\\nWe all go to the laser tag first. \"We'll play laser tag first and then just a few games.\"\\n\\nAs we get right to the front, they see the ropes course, and run off and abandon me, which happened to be the time the door opened to the laser tag. I was first in line, and ushered in by the moving line. I end up playing laser tag by myself and then sitting there at the entrance for half an hour cause I couldn't find them (the place is BIG) and they wouldn't answer they're phones.\\n\\nWhen they do come back, I glare at them, and Nate utters a quick \"sorry\". As were walking out an hour later, we're thinking of something else to do. It's now been four hours. Nate wants to go hang out with some people in theater, since the show just got out. This is where I draw the line. Hanging out with Abby was uncomfortable. Hanging out with the people he wants to hang out with sucks. I hate them and they hate me. It'd be terrible. I tell them, that this night has been awkward and been mostly bad already. I'm not going to hang out with that group and make it worse. I say \"Either, we can go hang out with Simon and Bob (my two best friends), go hang out at my place, or I'm going home. You can find your own way home, or I'll drop you off on the way back.\" He starts arguing and telling me \"It'll be fun.\" I finally just say \"You know what, go with Abby and Jane. I'm leaving\". \\n\\nThey knew the whole night that I was not having a good time, and pretty angry that I was getting stepped on.\\n\\nSo I get in my car and drive home, leaving Nate to get driven around by Abby. This was at 9.\\n\\nAt 11:30, I get a call from Abby saying she got pulled over, and got a ticket for having too many people in her car (she just got her license and can only have one person in the car with her). She blames me since I left her with Nate. But, she had also picked up another person, and it's been 2 and half hours since I left. Now Nate, Abby, and Jane all are calling me an asshole for causing Abby to get a ticket.\\n\\n\\nSo am an asshole for leaving my friend after a crappy night for me, and then being a part of the reason she got a ticket?</td>\n",

It's supposed to be practice for building up my public speaking/interaction skills.\\n\\nAnyhow, I ended up hesitating at nearly every opportunity to do my job, especially after I made a major fuck-up in charging a speaker's guests for parking. If I waited just a split second, my friend's wife would jump in and do it. So she ended up doing just about everything.\\n\\nAfter we'd finished the main part of the job, I mentioned to her that I wished I had done more. And she sort of told me \"Well that's the job, just smiling and letting people in. You hate it, right?\" I didn't really, I just felt like a fucking cunt. So I rephrased what I'd just said, and she told me that she didn't need my help if I hated it. I don't argue unless I'm absolutely being fucked over, so I just agreed and shut up.\\n\\nThen she sent me downstairs with my friend (the husband) to spend the rest of the event. Yesterday he messages me over Facebook and tells me that he'd prefer that I act like a grownup (I mean I'm 20, so partially there at least, and from a shitass household &amp;amp; social situation that constantly insulted me my entire childhood, I've told him this) and stop whining and complaining when he sends me to help with stuff, especially involving his wife. I tested the waters, stating that I'd like the job better described to me beforehand next time. He says that I should just shut up and take advice like a grownup (btw literally the word he used) and do better next time. Once again I just shut up, because pitting myself against a wife never ends well.\\n\\nI will admit I complain probably significantly more than other people, it's one of the few ways I get relief from stress, if a shitty one. It's half the reason for this post. And I know this quibble is going to become a problem from here on if one of us doesn't address it (and guess what social incompetent me is worst at?).

I don't want to watch it because it's almost certainly going to be a trigger for me because my brother was violently abusive, physically and emotionally, and the newest movie will bring all of this back up for me (explained in the description) when I've been trying so hard to move on. I've told him several times to take one of his friends so that they both have a good time but he thinks I should just come because it's only for a \"couple of hours every two years\". Should I suck it up and go or refuse?\\n\\nFirst: There's a reason why I'm not posting this in /r/relationships. They're paranoid and jump to conclusions and they demand everybody break up over the smallest thing. So please, no comments about my relationship because my partner has always been 110% respectful and loving. I'd just like an opinion about this one thing.\\n\\nMy partner loves Star Wars passionately. For weeks he has been asking me to watch the new movie with him and literally every single time he has asked me, I have told him that I don't like Star Wars (I can definitely understand why others do but the terrible acting and retcon distract me from enjoying it) and that I want him to take one of his friends (who all love it) because they'll enjoy it more. He gets hurt and says he wants to share his excitement for it with me.\\n\\nHere's the thing. My (26) brother was very, very abusive towards me for the first nineteen years of my life (I'm now 23). He regularly beat me, pulled knives on me (my childhood bedroom door had stab holes in it because he came at me with a cleaver and I only just got it shut and locked in time), spread rumors about me at school so I wouldn't have friends, screamed at me, encouraged me to self harm and commit suicide, and destroyed my prized possesions. All of this while crying loudly. For nineteen years, this happened literally about three times a week. I am not exaggerating any of this. He did the same to my mother and even blamed her cancer death on me (go figure). He is crazy and delusional and I have cut him out of my life. He is not mentally disabled, but I assume he has an undiagnosed mental illness.\\n\\nI'm still fucked up from this. I'm doing my best to move on but some things scare the shit out of me (I'm very resistant to using the word \"trigger\" because of how Reddit gets angry at anyone who says it but that's pretty much what it is) like if someone gets angry and screams suddenly, if I see a child throwing a tantrum, and if I'm forced to be around things that my brother destroyed. Star Wars comes into this because he destroyed all of our Star Wars toys in a fit of rage while screaming at me and trying to hit me. I can handle myself fine with seeing Star Wars merchandise and references and posters and stuff of course, but being trapped in a stuffy dark cinema for several hours being forced to watch that movie is different and will fuck me up. **He knows the reason why I don't want to watch it. I finally told him the true reason last night (after weeks of saying i didn't want to watch it because i hate the franchise) and since then he's been very distant and hurt but still says he wants me to watch it since it's only a few hours.**\\n\\nHe's upset and keeps going on about how he just wants to share something he loves with me. He doesn't want to go with a friend because he lost contact with them when he started a new job a couple of months ago that means he doesn't have much spare time. I know for a fact his friends would love to go with him and he would absolutely have the time if he didn't see me for one weekend.\\n\\nI know he loves me and is genuinely sad that I'm so resistant to enjoying something with him. I also know how weak and pathetic I  am by not being able to suck it up and go watch it. In my defence I only got away from my abusive brother in 2012, after nineteen straight years of him attacking me three times a week and it's going to take me longer than three fucking years to be completely okay after something like that.\\n\\nI'm thinking of the following options: \\n\\na) I email him more details about exactly what my brother did to me, because at the moment my partner just does not seem to get it even though he knows the overall story, and hope he realises just how badly this will hurt me. I'm worried this will be guilt tripping though.\\n\\nb) I harden the fuck up and go and not complain. This will essentially be bottling my emotions up though and he and I have always sworn to have a communicative relationship.</td>\n",

After a bit of a discussion over how dumb that was, he told me that he would not be able to pay me my 6k back, but he would instead send me $200 every fortnight until it was repayed, so rather then me getting my money back within 30 days, I am facing the realization of not being fully repayed for 30 fortnights (13 months).\\n\\nSo REDDIT, would I be the arse hole for asking him for my 6k by the end of January, with some sort of ultimatum, or should I just let it slide, knowing that maybe he can not afford the 6k and can not get the money off of anyone else.\\n\\nP.S\\nI have lent him 2k in the past to buy a new computer, which he payed me for within two months.\\n\\nP.P.S\\nMy savings was growing rather high, and I had began talking to people about either investing in stock or getting into the property game, and thought the month wait would not matter, but not I completely regret this decision.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nI lent a friend $6000 who said he would repay it within a month, after spending the money, he tells me that he can only afford to repay me $200 a fortnight until it is repayed</td>\n",

Even when he gets in fights with my mom he always takes one of my things, or maybe break it. I don't want to hurt him, but somethings I have too (The only times I've hurt him if he's hurting my mom.) He's always disrespectful to people my mom is dating, or friends with. Sometimes he's even the reason the person dumped her. I could go on for awhile about what he's done to me and other people, but I can't think of a time that he's been nice to me.\\n\\nWell I just wanted to figure out if I'm the asshole for not wanting him, in some cases wanting him dead.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Happy new year, reddit.\\n\\n\\nMy new year has not been very happy.. \\nTo start off, I am 18 years old and live in Australia. Tonight, I went out with 4 friends of mine. 3 of which I have known for years - one of which I have known for months, only meeting him about 3 times, but have come to become good friends with him. Let's  call him Bill. Anyways, Bill does \"graffiti\". By this, I mean he writes the word ,\"Anarchy\" or someshit in some stupid messy handwriting. There is nothing artistic about it. \\n\\n\\nAnyways, to cut a long story short, I was invited to a New Years Eve party where I only knew 4 people out of about 70. 2 of these 4 people, I hadn't seen in years, and only knew them through primary school. My other 4 friends, including Bill, knew nobody. I knew that Bill had spray paint and markers on him, and to be honest, I couldn't care less if he graffitied some random public property. Bill asked me at some point throughout the night if he should tag the house. I told him no. That was a stupid idea. He agreed. \\n\\n\\nHours later, I had left the party and was on the other side of the road of the house at a park with a girl I had met. We heard very loud, angry shouting, and the host kept calling the girl I was with, asking where she was and that she had to talk to her urgently. I thought nothing of it, as it was already 1am, and new years was over. I thought it was a fight between a few blokes and the rest of the party came out to watch them punchon, as we could see that the entire party had emptied onto the street. \\n\\n\\nMe and the girl hurried back, and as I walked back to the party, I could hear people talking about graffiti and tagging and how someone had tagged a bunch of cars.. Turns out my mate, Bill, had stupidly decided to SPRAY PAINT his stupid tag on the inside of the house and tag a bunch of cars, including the owner of the house and their uncle's car, outside with his whiteboard marker (luckily this was able to be removed easily).\\n\\nI walk back inside the house to get my bag, and as I try to leave, the bouncers, parents and brother and sister (hosts) of the party confront me. The bouncers intimidate me, saying they know that I know who did it. They say they want his name and to don't fuck around because if i lie, they will call the police and find out the truth the hard way. At this point, i am shaking because I had no idea how serious this was, but was starting to realise.\\n\\n\\nThe entire party had been kicked out and forced to go home. I reluctantly (I didn't want to see Bill get in trouble, but I had no choice) told them his name and the bouncers said ,\"Don't fuckin' lie. We are gonna search him up on Facebook and if you're lying you're in trouble.\" They cant find him at first and accuse me of lying, but I was telling the truth. Eventually they find him and at this point I have already apologised about 50 times to everyone around me, saying how I am so sorry for inviting them and how I had no idea he would do such a thing (I claimed that I had no idea he did graffiti, but I knew he did. I thought there was no point in saying I knew he did graffiti, as it would invalidate my word even though I was telling the truth - I truly had NO idea that Bill would do such a fucking stupid thing after I had told him not to...)\\n\\n\\nI continued to apologise as I wholeheartedly felt extremely guilty.. I could see everyone was very upset at what had happened. I was told to go home and I did. All of my friends had bailed, including Bill and I walked home, alone. I messaged the hosts of the party, saying that I was so sorry for what happened and how I would take full responsibility if the police could not contact Bill. They responded saying that their entire family was very, very upset and the mother and daughter were crying uncontrollably about everything that had happened. They told me to contact Bill and let him know that the police will be contacted if he does not go and apologise in person. I messaged Bill and told him what the go was. He said he understood and he was sorry (just to me). I'm not sure what he is planning on doing. He knows they know his name and school, so he'd be stupid to not go and apologise. \\n\\n\\nAm I an asshole for bringing Bill along, even though I had no idea he would do such a thing?\\nThanks, and have a happy new year :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello. This has been on my mind for a long time ever since I did the deed so to speak. Over the summer I ended a relationship with my long term SO. I know for a fact that it wasnt a very good break up for her at all. Just wondering what the community thinks. I am so sorry this is so long. I donโt want to give a half story. Sorry!\\nBackground:\\nShe (19F) and I (19M) had known each other since beginning of high school. We dated on and off. 1st time was sophomore year and it ended badly. Went on dates every weekend, did typical BF+GF stuff [;)], but she didnโt want to advertise it at school. Thatโs fine whatever. After 6 months my friend said he saw her with another guy at lunch. I confronted her about it and she said she didnโt know her and I were in a relationship. Whatever. I moved on.\\nSeveral months passed and we got together again. I made it \"official\" or whatever (dating is confusing) and we were fine. I get a text randomly out of the blue one day saying she wants to end it, but won't give me a reason. She had a 4th of July party the next night that I was still invited to, so I went. Saw her there with her new guy. Confronted her again and she said that he was her 1st love and wanted to see if he changed (Irony is a bitch), but didnโt want to cheat on me. Needless to say I was pissed and we never spoke for 2 years I think? Fast forward to junior year. I left half way through the year to become home schooled. Got an email from her randomly apologizing for everything she's done to me, and wanting to reconnect. My thought process was \"She's matured a lot, Iโd be fine to give it another chance, but no plans on dating\". Well one thing lead to another and we ended up back in the saddle together.\\nCollege:\\n2.5 years was our last stretch. We went to the same college and lived together after our 1st year at the dorms. We fought here and there while at the dorms, a lot of which was her not being able to communicate to me at all. She couldn't tell me if something was wrong, what her opinions were on certain things, or make decisions on absolutely anything. Every argument I defused the best I could. We never had weeks of no talking or stupid passive aggressive shit, just arguments that resulted in her crying a lot for fear she would lose me.\\nI did always communicate if there was something wrong between us. Mainly her inability to communicate, how she didn't seem to care about money, and she seemed to put herself first. I had to help her with everything regardless of what I was doing. I had to help her pack, get on her ass about getting ready to go, and had to help her study, but with very little reciprocation from her. Most things were defused but then we moved into together. Now she had brought one of her horse to college with her. I was against this from the start, but I never argued with her about it. Her animals are her responsibility, and I understand itโs emotional. I was annoyed when she said she couldnโt give up her horse because it means too much to her. I had quite a few pets but I found them all homes, because I know college is a large financial and time burden. It was hard but I did it.\\nMoving in:\\nWhen it came time to move into together I let her really find a place. She had to look for a place to house the horse on the property, because she just COULD NOT drive to her horse, and she would not budge on that fact. I helped with a large list of places, that horse boarding, but not knowing what was needed she had free reign. We ended up moving in to some duplexes on the same boarding facility as her horses (she had brought down another one of hers and her mini-horse).\\nThat was hell. I found out she had no plans to get a job before moving into there and only got one out of luck at the boarding facility on site. She said she didn't have time, while I was working 2 jobs and other EC activities. We had to share a bedroom, and I was not happy. She had to have her massive waterbed (9ft by 4 ft) in a 10 ft by 10 ft room. She could have her things, but I was limited in what my things I could bring. I was technically not a resident there, the landlord was cool with us, but I was told if the city inspects it then I am not there. And on top of that we were 30 minutes away from the campus, with 1 vehicle (mine), and then she brought her dog with her that during the school year we would have to come back and check on twice a day. Our gas bill, with me driving to work alone was $300 monthly.\\nSo shit got bad and we argued about the same stuff. She couldn't talk to me about anything, her still being absurdly dependent on me for everything and just general day to day bullshit. This was not 1 way either. I was told that I get frustrated easily and I curse a lot when I am mad. So I watched my words when I was upset, and tried not to be frustrated, but honestly it was just her bullshit that was making me mad. So it progressed and these fights kept progressing. Nothing breakup worthy by themselves, but all together it was a mess.\\nThe Trip:\\nThen the catalyst. I took a trip to big bend for 2 weeks at the end of summer. I actually convinced her not to go, because I knew she couldn't handle the hikes, I didnโt want to hear the complaining, and I know she was going to be worried about the animals. I admit it was a slime ball thing to do, but I was thinking for myself. I didnโt tell her those reasons but she agreed to it. Definitely an Asshole for that. but I digress.\\nGot into a huuuuge fight the day before. I was still planning, packing etc. and we had to go home (3 hrs away) for a few days leading up to the trip. She HAD to see her family and whatnot. So I got what I could done and told her that we will just have to leave early on Sunday (trip left Monday at 6AM). Then it came. On Saturday she had a bitch fit at me because she NEVER gets to see her family and I wanted to go see my grandparents. We went home at least once a month and we both slept at her families house. I would see my family for 2-3 hours tops at a time. Then Sunday came around, and she was upset because I wanted to leave at 10AM to pack and get things ready, plus go to the stores. That was too early we fought and ended up leaving at 5PM. It was Sunday evening in the bible belt. Nothing was open when we rolled back into town after fighting for almost 3 hours. I just let it go not wanting to be mad at her before leaving on a trip. Next day we ride over there so she can drop me off. There was around a dozen other people there for the trip. She starts going off on the people Iโm going to hate on this trip. Rude, and wrong. I ended becoming really good friends with the ones she pointed out.\\nOn the trip I did a lot of thinking. Only got 4 hours of sleep a night from this. Talked to a few unbiased patrons and came to the conclusion that I should end it before it hits a breaking point. Didnโt want to end it on too bad terms. And she really was a good friend. Get back from the trip and that just escalates quickly. She pulled up and was pissed because I didnโt run down and lift her up out of the truck and swing her around or something (her words not mine). I just got off of a 10 hour van ride and had pulled my shoulder on the trail. I explained but she was still pissed. She then got more pissed that I was waiting on someone. One of my new friends on the trip had forgotten her stuff, so I was waiting for her to come back. She did I brought it to her and hugged her goodbye. My SO believed that I was acting tired around her just so I wouldnโt have to do anything, and I was suddenly energetic around my friend. We argued until 4AM. Next day I went out and found an apartment, and ended it with her that night. Had my bags packed up and I told her I wanted to end it before I end up hating her. 1st words out of her damn mouth were โI donโt know what Iโm going to doโ. She cried and what not and then came all the bs. I was told I was emotionally manipulative, and unreasonable. I did this 5 days before school started again and that was apparently too much shit for her. I was told that I should have done this during school when classes had settled or during the winter break. I merely contested that I could not lie to someone for months about how I feel especially in relationship that was failing. I also contested that there is no good time for a breakup. I didnโt bullshit, or mull around. I did what I thought was right.\\nFew weeks ago we met up for coffee so I could get a few things I left. I apologized for how things ended and how I didnโt want to fight as much. We had a lot of history together, that I donโt think was wasted. She kept throwing in there the guys she was hanging around and how she kissed the bassist of LA GUNS. I donโt know if I am over analyzing or sheโs trying to make me jealous. Iโm not a jealous type at all.\\nNow this is a me rant, but she really did love me. She did everything in her power to make me happy, and she still is, in some weirdly disconnected way my best friend. I had a lot of fun with her in between the fights and I do miss a lot of things. Things were not 24/7 bad between us, itโs just I saw that where it was going and didnโt want to end up enemies. I just want to know am I the asshole here for crushing her heart and doing so right before school started?</td>\n",

Honestly, I'm uncomfortable with that fact - not the fact that he's gay but that he's sexually attracted to me. I just want to say now that I have 2 other good friends who are gay and I hang out with one of them a couple of times a week when I'm back in my home town and it's not awkward in the least - because why would it be? I don't give a shit that that friend is gay.\\n\\nMy housemate though: Sometimes when we're watching TV I'll look over and he's staring at me with a distant smile, for example. Whenever I make even a shit joke he'll laugh so loud and stare at me with some proud, longing expression that a wife would give to a husband she loves. It seems like he's always just trying to get attention from me and always seeking a positive response for every little action. Because of this, sometimes when he does little things that he obviously expects me to make a comment on or acknowledge I just stay completely silent. Last week I signed up to a friend's university research project data gathering session, and he came back to the house today telling me that he signed up for it as well. That's fair enough, I suppose, as we're mates to an extent but before I signed up for it he was laughing about it and saying 'no way I'm gonna sign up for that'. It just seems like he's always trying to be close to me and it kind of weirds me out. I like being by myself and to be honest it pissed me off that I don't get to do this thing by myself now.\\n\\nHe knows I'm straight, and he knows that I'm not interested in him in the least, apart from on a friendship level. But it's becoming hard to treat him the same as my other housemates because if I'm too nice then he just starts again. He'll start with the 'Oooh, thanks man, you're so niiiice :)\" or if we go to the shops he'll be like \"our first date, I'm so proud\". Whenever he makes a comment or something that conveys his attraction to me I generally just tell him \"shut the fuck up\" and change the conversational topic (but try to keep it civil on the new topic). It's rarely a direct comment but more often indirect one.\\n\\nAll of us in the house enjoy mutually abusive (in a jokey way) relationships, but I find myself being very minimally more cold towards him than my other housemates - it's as if I subconsciously feel I have to make him learn that there's nothing about me to love and I'm trying to get him to dislike me. However, this is a double-edged sword because one of the reasons he's into me is because I'm a tall guy and forceful / purposeful in my words and actions - he is really into my 'presence' apparently (he's a small guy and kind of obsessed with height).\\n\\nIt should probably be noted that I'm really bad with relationships of all kinds - I find it very hard to connect emotionally with people and struggle to generate and keep meaningful relationships with anyone; even my family. Even conventional, 'normal' relationships confuse and tire me. I'm 22, in my final year of university and haven't had a girlfriend here. I'm good looking and girls like me but don't go through the stress of getting with any and haven't brought any back to my house while we've been living together. Maybe he thinks (or hopes) I'm a closet homosexual and am just repressing my feelings? Although I doubt it as me and my other housemates have common conversations about certain celebrities on TV etc. and how we think they're hot.\\n\\nJust wanted to get this off my chest and ask you guys if I'm being the asshole here.</td>\n",

He's recently (in the past year) gotten his license, and is now on his Green Provisional (Where we live you have Learner license, Red Provisional and Green Provisional and then your full license).\\n\\nPreviously, I've called him out for creeping up over the speed limit when I'm in the car, to which he responds by slowing down, but protests or attempts to excuse it, each time. I used to think that was just his insecurities about someone chastising his actions (he's got middle child syndrome bad, and it's exacerbated by the fact that his family don't actually relate to him except to tell him when he's done something 'wrong'), and we're working on that. He's also admitted to speeding ('But not by much!') when he is driving late at night.\\n\\nWe've argued about this previously, and he knows I am very wary of bad driving habits (the city we live in has demonstrably the worst drivers in the country, with a young adult motor vehicle mortality rate that is nauseatingly high - one of our local politicians actually likened it to a meatgrinder). Every time, I've gotten so angry with his casual attitude and responses that I've had to tell him to drop the subject.\\n\\nAnd so, today has been... Challenging. Our university is doing a cross discipline theory unit, our lecturer doesn't know the material, so he and I are both frustrated by that. Furthermore, we have to do a group project which essentially doubles both of our study workloads.\\nOn top of that, Allan has been stressing over his personal assignment for this trimester, and is in a position of not really having any inspiration/a non workable concept that he's struggling to turn into a viable project. He's been sleeping badly, and has contacted his lecturers and tutors but then failed to follow up with a meeting or communicate effectively with them about his problems. \\nSo he's irritable and anxious, which he then inflicts on me, to which I respond by calling out his behaviour. I apologise for snapping at him, he apologises and acknowledges his behaviour, we move on. \\nBut today has been one incident after another, which has left both of us rather irritated. \\n\\nWhen I returned home, he'd messaged me to tell me he'd gotten a speeding fine for being 7km/h over the speed limit (want to mention, being under/over speed limit by 5 km/h here is an offense). It's dated from Valentines Day, near my suburb, where he'd gone from work to a local supermarket to pick up desert, and then sped to my house. He has no points left on his Provisional license, and it's a $100 fine. I'm happy to help him pay it off, but it's just the perfect end to an overly shitty day.\\n\\nI said I'd help him pay off the fine, and his response seemed to lack any sort of acknowledgement of the fact that he'd done something wrong. \\nSo I did something very stupid. \\nI asked him to be more mindful about his speed. I really shouldn't have done that. I just hoped he'd change his attitude or behaviour now that he had actually been fined for it. I worried, because it seemed completely bizarre to me that there was no contrition or recognition of his error. And usually he's VERY good at acknowledging when he's been at fault.\\nImmediately, he made the excuse of 'I'm 7 km/h over'. \\nI nearly lost my shit, but told him I wouldn't argue about it with him, that even from a monetary perspective, he shouldn't be doing it, and that we should drop the subject. \\nHis response was 'Forgive me for not sitting perfectly on the speed limit at 9 PM on an empty street on a Sunday that's also Valentines Day.' \\nI told him 'It could be my birthday, my funeral, don't care.'\\nI then told him I loved him and that he should go rest - he hadn't slept more than three hours, and I just needed to leave the conversation because I was furious. \\n\\nAfter all this, he literally has tangible evidence of the repercussions of his behaviour - which has potentially more dire consequences than a fine and a slap on the wrist - and he's trying to justify his actions by making it my fault.\\n\\nNow I just feel kind of hollow and disappointed with his reaction, and I totally admit I shouldn't have taken the bait, I shouldn't have started an argument with him about this shit. \\nI'm hoping it was the shitty day, the aggravation, exhaustion and stress, and getting this crap news on top of all of this, and that he's just operating from a crappy headspace.\\n\\nSo I know I am the asshole, but I just want to know if I'm the only asshole in this situation.\\n\\nTL;DR I'm an asshole, but do I have company?</td>\n",

I have been going to therapy for many years now and have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd.

My dad doesn't understand why I can't have a relationship with my mother and often tells me he wishes I could be around her to make her happier.

I was always just generally someone who didn't stand out, I guess. I had 2/4 high school birthdays where my classmates forgot my birthday and nothing happened aside from last minute throwing something together like \"oops we forgot sorry\". Plus I was vocal about the approaching date, just no one cared. What am i going to decorate my own locker? Lol\\n\\nSo here I am, 25 years old, thinking those days are behind me.\\n\\nI work at a bank where it's 90% women in my department. As much as I hate the stereotype that women are \"cliquey\" that's exactly the atmosphere here. There's currently a 20 year age gap between me and the rest of my department. All the older women operate like the high school girls I hated and I'm never included in anything unless it's the entire department being invited. I've never really cared much until recently.\\n\\nMy office started doing balloons for people's birthdays. I knew the minute this began, I wasn't getting one. So what did I do? A few days before my birthday I made my work instant message status something like \"birthday in 5 days\" so people would know. I get to work the day after my birthday (birthday was Sunday) luckily, expecting nothing and I got nothing. It was fine, or so I thought.\\n\\nNow my bosses birthday just past and my other coworkers birthday is today and they both got balloons PLUS they want me to come out to dinner for my bosses birthday. (Let me just mention that a total of three people said happy birthday to me on the Monday after my birthday, only one was in my department). Also last year I was at a different location for my birthday, got no birthday wishes but was asked to attend dinner for my bosses birthday.\\n\\nI'm asking if I'm the asshole here because I feel like an asshole. I just feel so stupid for caring about something so incredibly stupid!! I think it's just walking past their desks having to stare at this crap that bugs me. It's like high school me is coming back because it reminds me of walking past all the decorated lockers when mine was bare. \\n\\nSo everyone, how pathetic am I?</td>\n",

Now that I am out of college for the summer, she's asking me more often to take her places. AITA for not wanting to? I mean, I have no reason to say no other than just not wanting to...\\n\\nEDIT:\\nWe do live together at our mother's house. It's only 20 minutes from my University so I thought \"Why not save money for a few years?\" My father, who is not my sister's dad, pays for the insurance on the car, but both he and I are on the title because he lives in another state and I had a police officer stalking me because the car was still registered in his state. He gave it to me towards the end of my sophomore year of high school. He pays the insurance and for emergency maintenance, but I pay for everything else. One of the conditions though of me having his car was that no one other than me and him, and of course my mother (because she's my mother and I will always respect what she asks of me), can drive it. Also, due to my sister's driving history, I don't really trust it anyway. As for why my sister doesn't have a car, my mom got her a car when she was in high school, then she went off to college and kept parking in places that she wasn't supposed to and kept getting it towed. Finally, my mom got tired of it and took the car back from where it was sitting in a tow lot about to be sold for being there too long. My sister leased a car, got into an accident. Got another crappy car, had another accident without insurance, then got into some legal issues. Ever since then, and after moving back home, she's been driving my mom's car to work and using me for rides. She's been living with us ever since. She also doesn't have any money to buy a car because she owes student loans and for stealing about $1,000+ from my mom's credit card. I'm probably driving her about 40+ miles a week. Alternatives would be Uber, or a taxi, but my thing is that she's making all of these plans with friends to go to all of these places and parties so why can't she get her friends to drive her to said places? Why make the plans and then ask me or my mom if we have the possibility of saying no and then she's SOL about getting to said places that she planned to go to? \\n\\nAnother note would be that my car is 16 years old and has almost 300,000 miles on it.

From September to December I lived in his house and did my best to take care of it and even got furniture for the house, a TV, internet, cable, etc. \\n\\nCome December when he moved back everything was okay for a little while, but started to get upset at everything I did. I tried so hard to make him feel at home but apparently it wasn't good enough. He would get upset if I had friends over, or didn't clean enough, which was all I did almost everyday. He never cleaned his own house.\\n\\nThen February comes, he decided to adopt a giant 95 dog, which I was fine with. The problem is he was at work almost 9 hours a day, so I was stuck constantly taking care of his dog. I was a student at the time so I was home a lot. Then the dog started destroying everything. Mostly eating and chewing MY things. I expressed my concern to him and how I felt it was unfair I was stuck taking care of his dog and I didn't want to live my life around a dog. He didn't take it well and refused to get rid of this dog so I ended up moving back to my parents.\\n\\nNow I hear he's telling MY friends how I'm a jerk for moving out on him and he doesn't understand why.

Our apartment is a 4/4, so we each have our own bedrooms and bathrooms. All utilities are included in our rent except for electricity, which we split four ways and is usually very low from what I've heard. Two of the girls currently live there; me and another girl are replacing two other girls who are moving out.\\n\\nOne of my best friends \"Kayla\" is living in a dorm this year. She is working at a restaurant on campus, and needs to come up the week before school starts for job training. However, the dorm housing people didn't approve her request for an early move-in, so she doesn't have anywhere to stay for the four days before the dorms open. Naturally, I told her she was welcome to stay with me. I thought nothing of it since the only spaces I share with my roommates are the kitchen and the living room, and Kayla is incredibly shy so she won't be coming out there much anyway.\\n\\nMy roommates and I have a group chat that we made so we can see who has what for the apartment, decide what we still need, that sort of thing. A few days ago I texted the group chat and let them know that my friend Kayla would be staying with me from X date to Y date (four days).\\n\\nLater, one of my roommates \"Jordan\" replies, and her tone sounds really pissed off. It's probably pertinent to note that Jordan is one of the two who already lives in the apartment. I'd copy the whole text, but it was really long and pretty convoluted so I'll sum up. She basically said that that isn't the way we run things in the apartment, that we always get the other girls' permission before having guests, even if it's just for one night. She said she wasn't comfortable having a stranger in her home and asked me to tell Kayla she wasn't welcome to stay. The other two girls didn't say anything.\\n\\nI texted Jordan outside the group chat and told her that I wasn't going to uninvite my friend who needed a place to stay. I said I understand her concerns, and if I had someone who planned to stay longer than a week or so I would get everyone's approval first, but that I don't think I need her permission to host a guest in my bedroom for a couple days.\\n\\nJordan replied and brought up the electricity bill, and that she thinks it'll skyrocket with one more person staying there. (For four days?? I seriously doubt that, but I've never paid an electricity bill before so that's something I admit I'm in the dark on.) She said that if I insist on having an \"unwelcomed\" guest, I should pay more for the electricity bill that month. I told her we could talk about it when I move in in two weeks and didn't respond anymore.\\n\\nAITA for inviting my friend to stay in my room with me? I didn't think there was any way I could be since I have my own space, but now I'm not so sure. Is asking permission for every guest excessive, or is my roommate right? Should I offer to pay more for the electricity?</td>\n",

He never quite veered into physical with me, but he had beat on my mother several times throughout my life. I hated (And still hate) his guts, but was too scared to tell my teachers what was going on at home.\\n\\nMy dad eventually developed dementia, likely brought on by him drinking himself into it. He's had it for close to 10 years now (He was in his 50s when he was diagnosed) and my mom took care of him before she died. She did get POA over him, but she gave it back to him when she thought he had \"got better.\" (Yes, I knew that was fucking dumb. I miss her, but WTF?)\\n\\nI thought he had medicaid. So, my plan was when his condition worsened I'd stick him in a nursing home. However, I don't know when exactly, but he was switched to medicare because he (Or my mom, again I'm not sure when nor is anyone in the family) had allowed too much money into his bank account. That money sure as shit wasn't there when his condition worsened last year. I couldn't find anything to tell where, exactly, he had blew his money to. I was able to get him to give me POA, but at this point it was too little too late with nothing but a nicely worded \"Tough shit\" from the social worker who was helping me.\\n\\nI have told my mom's side of the family that I don't want to take care of him and that I, quite honestly, don't feel a shred of sympathy for him and they offer verbal support and say they don't blame me one bit. My dad's side, however, says I'm \"morally obligated\" to take care of my father regardless of how he treated me growing up (They also say he couldn't help the drinking nor the abuse since it's \"in the genes\") and that I'm a disgusting human being for not sympathizing with him for (probably) putting himself in this condition, occasionally saying if I don't I will have \"Failed my mom\".

       "      <td>So, some context. I (29f) have a friend (45f) who I met back in 2007 as she hired me. I was an exemplary employee and we were friends that respected the work/boss boundary. We haven't worked for said company for years, but we stayed close since. She's seen me work my ass off during my twenties. Despite the age difference, she's never had her financial shit in order. I have ALWAYS made substantially less than her/then husband. She borrowed $40 during a time when I could barely afford to eat because she really needed it. Because of the petty amount (albeit I needed it), I didn't mention anything... until years later when she was bragging about how she pays everyone back. I just mentioned it out of principal. \\n\\nShe started working for a large finance company and gained the employment by a referral. She recommended me and I was first interviewed in 2008  before the global economic crisis mandated hiring freezes on the finance sector. I didn't get the job, but in all fairness, I didn't have experience. I ended up getting into banking two years later and worked my ass up into a lending role. Back in 2014, I applied on her recommendation. This was while I had banking experience (asset), but not yet lending. I was passed in favour of a candidate that did have just a little bit more, but was told it was a very difficult position.\\n\\nSometime last year, I was doing better financially. Same friend has always been poor at managing her money (she makes about 20k more than I do, but with similar expenses). I wanted to go on  a weekend trip.. she desperately wanted to go but couldn't afford accommodation but said she'd chip in with food. I was OK with that. We went shopping for groceries and she started loading the cart excessively as though we were there for a week. I didn't moderate her because she said she'd pitch in for groceries. The entire weekend came and went, and she didn't spend a dime but took money out for activities for herself. I was perplexed, and followed up when we went home. I was a bit aggressive about it because I felt exploited. She felt really bad about her behavior. She paid me back (not what I was expecting). Time goes on, and I let it go.\\n\\nI quit my job after carefully saving up living expenses for a year. I took a job that an old contact sold me on. Completely based on lies. Staff is absolutely terrible and toxic. I get bullied and alienated. Friend knows this and is excited to tell me mid June that same company is hiring. By July I haven't heard anything, but she reassures me that they're just busy. I feel like an asshole, but don't ask her specifics by mid July. I just vented that with everything going on at my new job, that I was feeling very discouraged that I hadn't heard from them. I was on the receiving end of some bad news that affected me economically and I briefed her on that. During this time, she hits me up about three different times for money. I lent her $100 with the expectation that I'd get it back on 07/29 (Payday). The other two times, she found other arrangements before I could get back to her.\\n\\nToday I decided to touch base with her to simply ask her thoughts if she thinks I should touch base with the recruiter that I originally spoke to briefly or if she thought it would be too aggressive for me to follow up in person with the hiring manager that might recall that I was passed over. I was feeling very confused, because the job requirements cite one year of data entry experience and a highschool diploma. I am an excellent candidate and knock off everything they're looking for, including assets.  She hasn't paid me back the $100 that she said she'd pay back on the 29th. So I thought that I wasn't being a douchebag with disrespecting her boundaries since it would seem like she clearly didn't have an issue with violating mine.\\n\\nShe responds back that sorry, they hired someone... maybe talk to the recruiter, she says, as per my original query. \\n\\nI can't help but feel pissed because she knew how desperately i was looking to quit my job.i only stayed there so I don't have to account for a failed job experience. I feel it's reasonable to keep your friend informed not only about when they started interviewing, but more importantly that they had hired someone. I'm not sure if those points are valid, or if it's the fact that I've lent someone money whose breached my trust with money. Kind of like.. well, you don't respect me, so why should I respect you? \\n\\nAm I being the asshole here for feeling like I've been wronged? Would I be the asshole for calling her out on the fact that she sat like a waiting duck with Intel while I was going through hell? \\n\\ntl;dr AITA for being mad at my long-term friend for keeping me out of the loop for a job that she referred me for when she knew i was holding out to quit my job?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Last night (as of this post), my girlfriend of six years (22) and I (M/23) were getting ready for bed when she was bringing up buying herself a used car. She looked at me and said \"Will you help me buy a car?\" I said \"How?\" She replied, \"Just help pay for it.\" \"How much?\" I asked. \"All of it.\"\\n\\n             Now, before I continue, I should also make clear that our relationship is not that strong. We fight almost all of the time. In fact, almost all of our fights end with her threatening to leave, so because she does this often, I usually reply with \"Fine, go ahead,\" or something along those lines. I should also note that she makes more than I do, but she has more bills to pay. So, continuing, I said, nicely, \"Babe, you know I can't give you all of it.\" I thought she was just joking and she'd say something like, \"Yeah, I know,\" but instead she asks, \"Why not?\"\\n\\n          I could hear her tone change. I respond kindly, again, \"Because I just can't give all of it. I can help a little.\" \"What do YOU need it for?\" Her tone becomes a little more belittling. I believed she was taking a shot at me for not having as many bills as she does. I was really astonished, because she's been hounding me to save my money and not spend it on anything, big or small. \"I need to save up for the semester coming up. Babe, you can't have it all.\" To save time, she goes on a tirade about how after six years, people would think I was being irrational for not giving her all of my money. I argued differently. Finally, she ends it with, \"I was just testing you anyway. I wanted to see if you would and now I have my answer.\"\\n\\n            I lost my shit as much as a normally passive person would. I said, not shouted, \"Are you kidding me? You know our relationship is pretty rocky, why would you test it so recklessly, if at all? You're the one who told me to start saving my money, so why would you expect me to give it all to you? I would if it were a dire situation, like getting kicked out or medical bills.\" \"It doesn't matter,\" she said, \"I have my answer. I can't imagine being with someone who wouldn't do all that they can for the one their with AFTER SIX YEARS.\" We then argued about who was in the wrong. We stopped and she laid down facing the other way, and I did the same. She shut off the TV and we fell asleep without saying a word. SO, if I'm the asshole, please let me know and I will grovel my way back into her good graces.</td>\n",

Boys for themselves, and girls for themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNicole and I had known each other for a few months. She had just moved to our school and we became good friends in a short time. Nicole has a boyfriend, Jeff(M21), who's a very jealous type, but chose to trust that I wouldn't hit on(flirt with) Nicole. I wasn't interested in her anyways. Only as friends. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo at this trip, everyone got drunk, day and night, including me. But Nicole doesn't drink. So she was sober the whole time. She would lean up against me at night when we went to a mall or restaurant to eat. As in, her back, tightly up against my front. Often. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery night, Nicole would come into my room. She would lay on my bed, and I on my roommate's bed. He would always be out partying, so we had the room for ourselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery time Nicole left my room in the morning, my classmates would see her leave, so they're my witnesses. As their rooms were right next to mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last night, I threw up, drunk and dizzy. We both lay on the same bed. And she moved her hips forward and backwards, kinda humping my left leg. I held my hands around Nicole and put her on top of me. And she would, willingly, keep moving her hips in motion around my crotch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNicole leaned forwards at the same time so our heads would be right next to each other, while still moving her hips. I didn't make the move, to go for it. Nicole then got up and repeatedly said \"I can't do this, I have a boyfriend\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJeff called her while she was in my room, Nicole lied to Jeff and said she was in my room, so she could help me because I threw up and was dizzy and so on. She would then leave the room. We didn't tell anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast forward almost 6 months, Nicole chose to tell Jeff about what happened. But Nicole told a different story, that I tried to rape her on the last night, but that she managed to lock herself in the bathroom of my hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew Jeff, but we were only aquaintances. So I choose to travel almost 50 km to meet him, alone, and tell Jeff the truth. But before I managed to finish my first sentence, Jeff hit me. And started stomping my face while I lay on the ground. Spitting too. I didn't fight back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm 190 cm. Strong build. I could easily eat Jeff, who's short, tiny, and weak, but I didn't. I'm kind of a pacifist and also I felt a bit guilty. But I feel like his anger should've gone towards Nicole, and not me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter he left, I called Jeff. Told the truth. He acted like he believed me, and said they weren't together anymore. But after almost a year, I saw them, still together. I don't care that they are together or what not. I just feel bad for him. Nicole clearly has Jeff around her little finger. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm just pissed that I took a beating and he didn't get anything back. I can easily get my revenge. But I'm also kind of a pacifist, so it's a bit of a struggle, I guess. He has cousins from my city, but they don't dare to say anything to me, because I have people behind me, whom they are scared of. Jeff didn't knew this before he beat me. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter I took the beating, one of my boys threatened Jeff and he got scared. But I said to my boys that I don't look for revenge. My cousin then chose to speak with Jeff, and he cried this time over the phone. Scared. He isn't man enough to travel almost 50 km to meet up, in my city. I told my cousin not to do anything about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the whole situation, a boy, Sam(M20) from the same class as Nicole, came and told me that Nicole kissed him on his cheek before the trip. Sam told Nicole that he has a girlfriend, and that he did nothing wrong there (when Nicole kissed him on the cheek). Sam tried to confirm to me that Nicole is bad, and not me...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. And sorry for the bad English, it's not my native tongue.

Instead of mowing the trim however, he mows over everything I already did; saying it wasn't done (Even though you could very clearly see the difference of what was done and what wasn't.) I confronted him about it (Calmly mind you.) and he goes off and gives me his attitude as per the norm. Things obviously verbally escalate, and he tells me to leave (Even though I was calm the entire time.) And I know if I left, nothing would be done about it.\\n\\nFlash forward to today, and he made himself some lunch (School's out for today.) He always has a problem with making sure he gets his dirty dishes inside the dishwasher, and he usually leaves his messes for someone else to clean up. Today is my mother's birthday, and in knowing this; I knew she would be absolutely livid if she saw the mess he made. I went to his room (Again, calmly) To tell him to clean up his mess, and to do so very quickly. If either of my parents would see the mess he made of the kitchen, they would be pissed. And I didn't want them to get mad on my mother's birthday, and I didn't want to clean his mess up for him because he needs to learn to do it on his own.\\n\\nI go out to get a snack as he's cleaning, and I told him how we get along for a week or so and he becomes an insufferable douche. Then he tells me that he can't wait until I move out, even though it probably won't happen and he called me a fat ass with a superiority complex. All because I told him to clean up his mess, and mow his part of the lawn (Which hasn't even been done yet.)\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: Thank you so far for the feedback! I'll definitely try and tone down how much I tell him what to do.\\nI would like to mention/ask a few things however. I'm not looking to change minds, I genuinely want help.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter whether or not you ask him kindly to do something or tell him. A majority of the time he will get huffy about it. Even with my parents.\\n\\nThe only one he doesn't seem to have a problem listening to is our oldest brother (21). And they never fight whenever he tells him to do something, and he even agrees that I'm usually right on most matters.\\n\\nIs there any way for me to ensure that he'll start cleaning up after himself without sounding bossy? Or for my parents to do so? I don't want them to have to clean up after him, nor do I think I should have to either.\\n\\nOnce again, thank you for the responses! I'll keep them in mind next time a think a confrontation might happen. I'll definitely try to ask him instead of tell him more often, and I won't pester him about his chores as much. Thank you!</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I have pretty solid plans to move out of my parent's house in a few months. I have a place to stay and all that. I've tried to discuss this with my parents so I'm not just walking out the door one day, but they refuse to listen. They like to pretend it's not happening. I'm the oldest sibling, so I understand that cutting the cord must be hard. But it's bound to happen eventually.\\n\\nI had posted on Facebook that I was at a bar near where I'd be moving to. A friend of mine commented saying I was minutes away from her house. I responded saying I'll be moving down there in a few months and we can hangout and whatnot. This was posted last night.\\n\\nThis morning I wake up to a text from my mom saying that before I go posting things like that on Facebook I should talk to her and dad first. I responded saying that I've tried and they won't listen. I know when I get home later today they'll want to have a discussion about how I need to watch what I post online and blah blah blah (I'm 21 for god's sake. I make an innocent joke about Ted Cruz awhile ago and my mom gave me a long chat about that).\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like at my age, and the fact that I pay all of my own bills already (insurance, car, phone. Everything except medical.) should be grounds that I can move out basically whenever I want.

My boyfriend hates unnatural hair colors and while he says he'll love me regardless he thinks it looks trashy and he is gonna be bummed out if I dye it. I think I'm gonna do it anyway. Am I an asshole?**\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half now. He's loving, caring blah blah blah. We have a great relationship with some minor conflict, but everything has been getting better (he grew up in a shitty household and this is his first real long term relationship, so he's kinda learning how a healthy relationship works). He's 25 and I'm 21.\\n\\nWhen I go through periods of stress I usually get myself a big \"gift\", usually something that is a big change. I'm in college so generally this is once a semester. Last semester I got a cat, the semester before that I got a pet snake, the one before that I went platinum blonde and the one before that I dyed my hair red. For some reason it helps me cope with stress. \\n\\nSo it's getting to that time again and I figured my \"gift\" this semester would be dying my hair some crazy colors. I've always wanted to do that and I feel like if I do it I need to do it soon since I probably won't be able to after graduation because I'll have a job (or at least be seeking one). I've been floating the idea past my boyfriend for a few months but yesterday I asked him in earnest to tell me what he thought. I sent a few pictures of styles I liked for his opinion and he confessed that he hated unnatural hair dyes, thought they looked trashy and that he really couldn't see himself liking any hair dye on me because he likes my natural color. \\n\\nI even tried photoshopping some different hair colors on a picture of me to see if that would change his mind (and because it was fun) but he still hated it. He told me I could do what I want, that he would still love me but that he prefers my natural hair and mentioned that if I had an appearance preference for him, he would do it. He told me he would still support me regardless and that it's my body to do what I want with, he was just gonna hate the way it looked.\\n\\nInitially I figured I would just not dye it and that would be that, but I'm having a really hard time giving up on the idea and I feel like I'll regret it later if I don't go a little crazy now while I have the chance. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just do it anyway but I feel shitty. I know if he wanted to do something like buzz his hair that I wouldn't like I'd be kinda disappointed too, I don't blame him at all for that. But does doing it anyway make me an asshole?</td>\n",

My (F26 white non-religious) good friend (F26 white non-religious) started going off about how much she hates Christmas, because it's racist and exclusive and unfair, et cetera. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I do not think Christmas is racist. I will admit that it's unfair that most Christian holidays are Canada's federal holidays, but whatareyougonnado. Really I think no religious holidays should be federal holidays, and we should just get extra Vacation time in lieu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso worth noting that I am really trying to get into the Christmas \"spirit\" because of how dark and dreary the days are getting. I mainly see Christmas as a celebration with lights and decorations and being with those you love. My bf and I have planned a week long holiday to New York for Christmas and I'm very excited. She knows all this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis isn't the first time in the last couple weeks that she's ranted a little about Christmas' racism and exclusion. Over the weekend, I had sent her a bunch of pictures of my cat in a cute reindeer sweater. She had responded positively with \"CHRISTMAS BABY!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo when she was ranting I smiled and was like \"haha, you can't hate Christmas thaaaaat much when my kitties are so cute in their Christmas sweaters!\" she kind of laughed and was like \"yeah, no I hate Christmas.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOk, fine, whatever. I didn't think anything of it. It didn't feel like a negative interaction to me. But I guess I really struck a nerve, because about an hour later she sent me an instant message basically saying \"I can hate Christmas and all the racist things about it and still like pictures of cats,\" but longer. I couldn't think of anything to say so I just didn't reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike, ok? Yes? Of course you can? I was just teasing... It wasn't like I was roasting her loudly in front of all our friends, it was just a quiet smiling prod, like we do sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, she hasn't talked to me since. I'm hesitant to say anything as I feel alienated. AITA?\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

and plays for money. I live at home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and younger sister.\\n\\nThe hours my team and I play are between 6pm and 12am every night, although not for 6 hours continuously; it may be 9pm till 12am, or 6pm till 10pm, etc. and obviously I'm talking during those hours. Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\\n\\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\\n\\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this, all because I game competitively and am trying to win money from winning events?   \n",

My first roommate dropped out in October, and I got a new one to start he 2nd semester. He's the worst. Here's some of the undesirable qualities about him.\\n\\n* Incredible snoring. I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven't approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was \"have you told him about your snoring??\" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It's too loud not to know. This is fine, you can't help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I'm not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point...\\n\\n* He's a lazy fuck. He's very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it's because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn't do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn't help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality..\\n* He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn't stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a \"stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3\". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn't even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it.\\n\\nTonight though, I thought about something. I am talking about him a lot. I mean, he gives me a lot to talk about. However, I feel like I may be just as bad as he is, talking about him and the things he does with my friends and floormates behind his back. So, am I the asshole? Am I the asshole for talking about him so much and making such a big deal out of him, or is he simply the asshole and I'm responding to that?\\n   \n",

years ago my 19-year-old son got a new gf.  After I met her, I told my son (let's call him Tyler) that I thought Katie* was really sweet and smart and looked like she liked to eat.  Ok, I know that sounds bad, but Tyler's previous gf Dakota was borderline and refused to eat in front of anyone, and it always bothered me. I mean, if Tyler invites you over for a holiday meal, at least sit at the table and play with your food.  I guarantee no one would notice, but they will notice you sitting on the couch sulking.\\n\\nBut I digress, and I had to, to make the rest make sense.  About a year later, Tyler and Katie were hanging out here and he tells her what I said.  She looked kind of upset, and I know she thought I was making a comment about her weight, but I swear I wasn't.  I explained the whole Dakota situation, which she should've understood because she knew her and hated her with a passion.  I apologized, and explained what I meant.  I thought we were good.\\n\\nCut to **three** months later.  I'm at work and get a text from Katie's mom:  \"You're a fucking bully!  How dare you talk to an 18-year-old child like that.  You told my daughter she was a fat pig!\"\\n\\nWhat?  She texts back:  \"You're a sad pathetic cunt picking on a child.\"  This goes on and on.  I mean, I thought we were friends.  This literally came out of fucking nowhere!\\n\\nI tried to explain that I love to cook, and I love when people come over and they like to eat.  I really don't give a shit that the girl weighed 200 pounds.  Whatever.  My son loved her, so I loved her.\\n\\nSo am I an asshole for saying a girl looks like she likes to eat?\\n\\nEdit:  I forgot to mention that later on Katie's mom said she'd call the cops because I was harassing her.  I was ignoring most of her texts but at that point I texted her my address and said please, call the police.  Needless to say, she didn't.   \n",

A few days ago I got invited to the most popular kid(Phillip) in the grades house to play FIFA. No big deal. (Keep in mind I'm about middle class on the social totem pole) I have a clingy friend (Shane) that's relatively low on the social scale, but I still try to hang out with him. I skype him from time to time and while skyping, he asked me what I've done for spring break so far. I told him I went to Phillips house and Shane flips 2 1/2 shits. He freaks out and gets mad that I didn't bring him along. I said that he should chill and that I just didn't think of it. He said he's afraid that I'm leaving him, which honestly might be true. I don't want to completely leave him behind, but if it comes down to it I know I will. I told him that he needs to chill in social situations and try to curb the random shit he says or I won't be able to hang out with him anymore. (Shane has ADHD and doesn't stop saying random shit) Even still, I'm not sure if he's gonna be a casualty of me moving up. Am I the asshole for not hanging out with him as much, and not inviting him?   \n",

needed.\\n\\nOkay so for context, I'm a 21 year old male and my parents divorced about 3 years ago after many years of fighting. The divorce has been very \"messy\" with my parents constantly putting me and my 17 year old brother in the middle. Both my brother and I live with my mom and see my dad a few times a week. \\n\\nBoth my mom and I work at a hardware store together. My dad came in yesterday, like he usually does every now and then, looking at some clearance items in flooring and decided he wanted to buy some plus order some more. I told him I'd handle it all and call him later. I was told to put his items aside in the back and called him when I left work to let him know. He said he and his girlfriend would come in later that night to make sure she liked everything my dad was planning to purchase. \\n\\nMy mom was working at that time so I texted her letting her know they were coming to give her a heads up. Later my mom freaked out saying I shouldn't have brought him to the store, although he came by himself, and I shouldn't help him because of the way he treats her and she let everyone at work know that I don't live with him so if I let him use my discount I would be fired. She also threatened to not come home that night, but she eventually did really late.\\n\\nWe've been going back and forth all day. She thinks I should have told my dad not to bring his girlfriend in. My dad isn't a reasonable person so I don't think he'd listen, and I really dont see how I'm supposed to control what he does. I'm also upset that she blames this whole thing on me when it seems like it's a problem between them. I'm also not happy about her airing out our dirty laundry for all our employees to see and also threatening my job.\\n\\nI'm sorry this is so long but if anyone has actually read all of this and would like to offer an opinion it'd be greatly appreciated.    \n",

a very conservative Christian family that raised me up through private school with the sole intention of me going to a 4 year college. I have always known that this is not the career path that I wanted to take, but in fear of disappointing them, I never told them and ended up actually attending a semester at a very nice college with the hope that it would grow on me. It only made me even more sure of my decision to quit and go into a field that only requires specific training. My mom was understanding and more supportive than my dad, who has never been the same since. Everything up to this point only serves as contet for the actual altercation. \\n\\nI was 18 when this happened. I had been home for a couple of months and searching for a part-time job by my parents' demand. I was sending out dozens of applications, but my complete lack of prior experience was making it difficult to even get a call back. One day my dad gets home from buying pool chemicals and tells me that they had a help wanted sign on the door and for me to apply online for it immediately. I didn't have a problem with this, so I went to the website to check the listing. It was a 21+ management position. Later, he asked me if I applied, and I told him that I was underage and not qualified so I didn't bother. This made him very angry, telling me that I would do what he said and to send in the application anyway. I repeated that I was 18 and have never had a real job before, much less a management position. We argued back and forth with the same thing for a bit and it eventually came to him saying \"I'll just apply for you. Give me your resume and be quiet.\" I said \"I don't have one, so you'll be sending in nothing,\" to which he replied \"Don't be a smart ass.\"\\n\\nA little more context to go with the first bit: I had heard my father curse only once before this, and it was after a severe injury, so this marked a serious escalation in the seriousness of situation where my family is concerned. The tone he used in saying this was very agressive and threatening, so my 18 year old reaction was that I wasn't going to take verbal abuse from anyone, so I said \"Was the language supposed to drive the point across harder?\"\\n\\nAnd this broke him. He got up from his chair and started walking toward me saying \"How about I beat your ass right now?\" My adrenaline replied \"Do you want to try?\" At this point my mom ran in screaming at my dad to stop, and he backed away from me but continued to the heart of what he was going to say. As best I remember it, he said \"I'm sick of your fucking bull shit and I'm sick of you. I pay out the ass for your school your entire life and you thank me by dropping out of college after one semester and pursuing a white trash job. You're an ungrateful little shit and it makes me want to leave this house.\" And then he stormed off. \\n\\nNow to the present, I'm still at home finishing up mechanic's school, and our relationship is still very awkward. We rarely speak. My mom has always sided with me on this situation, reminding me that his mother was severely bipolar and his father killed himself, so he probably inherited a mental illness and to not take what he says too personally.\\n\\nThe way I see it is that there were many times in the fight where either of us could have ended it more peacefully, but in the end it comes down to my dad not being supportive of my career choice and selfishly wanting me to do what he wants me to do.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n   \n",

I've been living in a house belonging to an old man in his seventies. Last night I was talking with him, which is always just me asking him questions and him answering. I finally asked him why he doesn't ask me anything or try to invite me to the conversation at all, and he told me that I was too young for my thoughts to be of any interest to him. I got upset with that and we had a brief fight followed by me going back to my room. I still feel like he's a dick. Am I the asshole?   \n",

my life hasn't been very fun. My parents divorced early and I lived with my mom from 6-13 in Ohio, whereas I had been in Texas before. Anyway, When I was 13, I came home from school one day and my mom had been arrested for like the 5th time for doing drugs. But this time was permanent. (I haven't seen her since.)\\n\\nAfter that, my grandma drove up to Ohio from Texas to get me, and brought my dad with her. Then we drove back, and I moved in with my grandma. My grandma is awesome. Anyway, I found out shortly after moving in that my uncle would also be living with my grandma. My uncle is 40. He has \"mental problems\" as my grandparents describe it, so they use that as an excuse to put up with his bs, such as leaving messes everywhere, trashes my grandmas car, never having a job, and they said he will probably never move out because is isn't capable.\\n\\nSo that went on for about 2 years, and oh man I hated it. His blatant disrespect for how lucky he was made me so angry. He was practically sucking financial resources out of my grandparents for free because he was lazy. Two years of rent free life. That combined with the fact that he is an enormous jerk really makes me hate him.\\n\\nAfter those 2 years, my grandma brings up that my dad, back in Dallas (I live in a very small town about an hour away) has been living on the streets long enough, so she lets HIM move in as well. When HE moves in, he does the same thing as my uncle. Freeloading, whining, being ungrateful, and just generally being a drain and a pain in the ass.\\n\\nHaving to live with these two constantly makes me dread being home. It has made me really sour. I literally never smile when they are around, and I never speak to them. When they speak to me I just answer with quick one word answers and try to end the conversation as quickly as possible. My uncle still lives here, going on nearly 4 years (I'm 16.). My dad has been here for about 3 months, but he is no closer to moving out than he was when he got here. I am constantly reassured he will be gone as soon as he gets his first paycheck, but he doesn't have a job and I'm not holding my breathe. My grandma knows I am super unhappy with them being here, but she and my sister both say I am being a dick. They say that my dad and uncle are family, and I shouldn't hate them, that I should give them more chances.\\n\\nSince my entire life all of my family, besides my little sister and grandparents, have been drug addicts, failures, and freeloaders, I never really learned to value family. I just don't feel it. But I do feel intense anger towards both of these gents.\\n\\nSo there you go, reddit. Am I justified? Am I being unreasonable?   \n",

sell my PS4 for a while and my brother (who was visiting for the weekend) offered to but it for 160 dollars. Now I'm pretty desperate to get rid of the thing since I've built my own PC and now never use the ps4, but 160 dollars is a laughable offer. I rejected the offer very quickly since I know they're going for about 340 on average on eBay. He proceeded to not talk to me the rest of the day and his last words before leaving the house to go to the airport was \"don't be so selfish eh?\". Should I have been generous and given the console to him for 50% off due to our blood relationship or was I justified in refusing the offer? For a little context, I'm 17, so money is harder to come by at my age then at his (he's 34). And it's not like I wasn't going to give the price a little leeway, I was willing to go down to 230. Anyways, enough excuses, tell me how it is.    \n",

My parents are pretty much divorced right now and my dad has been on his own for about a year now. I have visited him maybe once a month during this time while my brother has been staying with him almost every other week (he is 12, so no choice). Im starting to feel really bad for being a loner and not visiting. There is nothing wrong with my dad, I love him a ton. I just like to be alone in my room. My excuse this whole time has been that I have college and two jobs, which I do, but I still have plenty of free time. If my parents' roles were switched, I would just stay in my room at my dad's place. Am I being an asshole, or is this normal?\\n\\nAnd if you have any advice I would love to hear it.   \n",

                                                             I'm 20/f and live with my parents. I told my parents I would be out late and asked them to not wait up for me because I didn't know what time I'd be home. \\n\\nSo about 1:00 I get an angry text from both parents saying \"you're being extremely inconsiderate\" and \"you better get your ass home, now.\" \\n\\nI understand that I live under their roof and it's their rules, but I pre-warned them. Is 20 not old enough to stay out past curfew? I've never been a bad kid. I've always done everything I can to appease my parents. These last couple years though, it's begun to affect my relationships. No man wants to hear, \"sorry we can't go out tonight, my parents want me home by 9:00.\" So I've started venturing a little. Should I just stop until I move out?\\nAny advice on how to handle this is more than welcome!   \n",

context. Me, 22M, her, 20F.\\n\\nWe had a bit of a shouting match last night over getting the apartment cleaned up. I feel I shouldn't have to do as much as she's asking since I'm basically paying all the bills other than the internet/netflix bill, and I work 50+ hours a week.\\n\\nShe, consequently, only does nanny work occasionally as she can find it, so I only find it fair she should do most of the cleaning if she isn't working as often.\\n\\nI think I'm being pushed, when I'd expect her to do her fair share, considering I also do a lot of the dishes, vacuuming, laundry, etc. The least she can do is cook and clean if she isn't working.\\n\\nSo, who's the asshole here?   \n",

       I was promised a raise when I first got this job. The raise never happened. I have been working at this company for over a year and I was promised $14 an hour, only got $10. \\nSo when the boss asked for a new website I found a template and said it took me 60 hours to make.\\n\\nAbout 2 weeks later another employee showed me a website he made on wix and said \"Steve (our boss) Likes this website more than yours, and it only took me 2 hours to make\".\\n\\nAITA?   \n",

                    I really don't want this to come off as a whiny tumblr post, but here goes:\\n\\n\\nI'm pretty much of a \"rebellious\" nature. Whenever someone directly orders me to do something, I get offended by them for not asking nicely, so I get very tempted to do the opposite of whatever they tell me to do, or just call them out on it.\\n\\n\\nI'll try to cut it as simple as I can: I made a new friend this year that is pretty nice and all, but is incredibly straight-forward with everyone. He has told me on multiple accounts as a response to plans that I've proposed with: \"No, that's incredibly fucking stupid\". I'm scared I may have adopted his trait of being straight-forward with people, which is terrible because:\\n\\n\\nA. No one's going to change\\n\\nB. I've, if anything, separated myself further away from having more friends.\\n\\n\\nAlong with that, I've made the stupid decision of telling my dad \"jokingly\" that I \"never have plans because I don't have phrase\", and he took me up on it 100%. So now, whenever I'm a bit more \"straightforward\" with my dad and he doesn't like my opinion, he'll bring up the point of \"maybe you shouldn't say that so you would have more friends instead of slouching in your room every single day\" (which is true; 90% of the time, I'm in my bedroom).\\n\\n\\nA bit of backstory on my dad: basically, he's dedicated himself to always \"live happy\", and by doing so, makes a fool out of himself by calling me cutesy names (even though I'm 16, and obviously annoyed at them), attempting to spark conversations with dogs by repeating the phrase \"What's going on with you? What's going on with you?\" 27 times at a barking dog that would be on the other side of the room while people are directly looking at him, and doing the opposite of what you tell him to do (he always serves my mom an excessive amount of food, even though she always says that she does not want any more).\\n\\n\\nEither way, we've gotten into more and more arguments, and I don't know if he's being the asshole, or if I am. Comment if further detail is needed. Thanks.   \n",

basically starting my own life. Ever since I was little, I have never gotten along with my dad. We don't have the same interests, the only time we speak is if something needs to be done or if a question needs to be answered, and just never really spent time together as I was growing up unless we were forced to (family vacation, ect). We do not casually chat or have deep conversations, the only time I can think of an instance like this was when I was checked into rehab for suicidal threats where we both broke down and promised to try and fix our relationship but that didn't hold up even a week after I got out. We would always argue and disagree until it got to the point that we just started ignoring each other even when we were in the same room. I can count on my hand the amount of texts I have ever sent my dad. Since I recently graduated and my younger brother just turned 16, my dad said that he would get me a new car and pass down mine to my brother. When we were having lunch (silently) after looking at some used cars, we got into an argument that lead to screaming. He got frustrated that I would be so rude as to raise my voice when he does all these nice things for me like pay for my college and buy me a car. I am thankful for these things but afterwords he asked me if I even wanted to have a relationship with him. I honestly didn't know what to say because I knew that I do not want to have a functioning relationship with him like I do with my mother, but he said that it makes him sad because he wants to have a relationship with me more than anything. When I got home I got into my room and burst into tears because of how bad I felt for not wanting a relationship but deep down I know that the emotional scars and 17 years of disconnect has really fucked me up to a certain extent but he doesn't know as I rarely spend time with him. Am I the asshole?    \n",

been with my Asian-american girlfriend for 3 years, when we first started dating I was a terrible student. I have met her mother and her older sister and we are in a long distance relationship (about 230 miles) I see her 1 or 2 times a month on average.  That's the basics out of the way. \\n\\nAfter a year of dating I asked to meet her dad, she said no way not until I have a college degree. I didn't think much of it at the time but as we dated I really started working hard to finish and graduate. I am now just under a year off of graduating with a degree in Public Relations and I asked her if we could sit down and talk about where each of us are at in school. How she feels about in the future possibly sharing an apartment (makes sense financially), and also me meeting her father. \\n\\nShe got angry and shot me down, saying that she wouldn't even talk to me about it. I have tried to bring it up a few times but each time she says no or acts like it is some sort of interrogation. I understand why she is worried about her dad but its been 3.5 years, he knows I exist, moving in makes financial sense but i'm not set in stone on that, and she wont even talk to me about school just gives me run about answers.  \\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting to sit down and start making long term plans/goals. I'm 24 and am in the starting process of really looking at the long term of my life. I want to either move forward in this relationship or start to loosen it up so I can enjoy my last year as a college kid. I do love her but I can't put time into something that isn't going anywhere anymore. \\n\\nThe catch is this weekend I am going to town to celebrate her birthday that was last week. Is it to assholeish to talk to her this weekend about it? To be clear I do want to be with her and she is one of the few people I could see a future with...but I can't be with her if she wont communicate or doesn't have the same long term goals as me. \\n\\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for wanting to talk to my girlfriend about plans for the future on her birthday weekend even though she refuses to talk about it? \\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses, I have decided to lay off meeting the parents as that may be a cultural thing that I just don't grasp. I'm going to work on communication and if she truly doesn't want to talk then I will have to start thinking that this relationship isn't going anywhere.  Thanks so much for the responses I think I found one of my new favorite subreddits!    \n",

I am 19 years old.\\n\\nMy friend Jeremy had a new years eve party at his house. His younger sister, Gretchen, had a few friends over as well but since they were juniors in high school at the time and we were in college, they weren't around us most of the night. I am pretty  drunk by the end of the night, and Gretchen's best friend Lola decided to ditch her young friends and join the partying college kids. Lola and I hit it off, and we are talking for a long period of time. She shows me her tattoo, we talk about how hard it is to find jeans that fit properly (we are both quite tall), the whole bit. I wake up the next morning and Lola is gone, and I was kinda disappointed. \\n\\nI get a text from Gretchen saying that Lola wants my number, she was just too nervous to ask for it the night before. I oblige, and we start texting. She starts getting very serious about things and wants to hang out really bad and asks how serious we are and where this is going (which I am fine with, and I find very attractive actually)I am then informed that she is only 16 years old, and I realize that a relationship isn't going to work if I have to go back for spring semester in a week. And even after that, she's still in another year of high school. So I tell her that unfortunately I can't do the long distance thing, especially from college to high school. We are at different points in our lives and have different priorities. She is extremely understanding, and very cool about it. Then a few weeks later, she texts me and asks to hang out one weekend that I'm home. I politely decline and say something would happen between us, and then I would have to leave again for school and it would be too hard. She says, and I quote,\\n\\n \"pantherlax56 I'm not trying to start a relationship, I just want to hang out with you.\"\\n\\nI again politely decline the offer. She texts me intermittently after that, and I say maybe we can get together over the summer when I'm home for while. She says that sounds good. The texting pretty much cuts off a few days later.\\n\\nFast forward to the summer. Im home from school, and I'm ready to party with my friends I haven't seen in awhile. So my other friend, Richard, invites me over to his house for some beers. We watch F1 qualifying, and start talking about girls. As it happens, Richard and Lola are good friends. He tells me that she has been talking about me non stop, and he repeatedly told her \\n\\n\"you guys will be a thing over the summer just wait\"\\n\\n because he couldn't deal with her constant mentions of me. We're both pretty drunk, and he says, \\n\\n\"hey dude, its Lola's birthday today. If you wanna make someone's day, text her.\"\\n\\n So I do. We pretty much pick up right where we left off and things start getting hot and heavy pretty quick. We start making sexual innuendos on a daily basis, talking about \"studying extra hard\" for her finals and making sure she's \"extra prepared\" for her male reproductive system test (she's in nursing classes). I think to myself: \\n\\n1. I expressed my feelings about a relationship awhile ago, and she understood\\n2. She told me she didn't want a relationship either, just to hang out\\n3. We are talking very sexually within days of talking to each other for the first time in months\\n\\nAnd I conclude that we both want a casual hookup FWB type thing. So I ask to hang out, she says sure. I ask if we can hang out at her place, she says there is \"nowhere to go\" (furthering my assumptions of a casual sex thing). So I say she can come over to my house and we can \"study.\" She says sounds great. She comes over, we have sex, she goes home. I get a text from Lola that says, \\n\\n\"so what does this mean?\" \\n\\nand I ask, \\n\\n\"what do you mean, what does this mean?\"\\n\\n\"are we casual or is this going anywhere?\" she asks.\\n\\nI explain that I made an assumption based on what I thought were obvious clues, and I apologize, but my feelings about having a relationship with someone far away and still in high school haven't changed in 2 months. I apologize profusely, and reiterate the fact that we already talked about not being in a relationship and just hanging out. I thought I knew what that meant, but I was wrong. She gets very upset, and doesn't talk to me.\\n\\nI have now come to find out that Lola explained (in graphic detail) what her and I did to Jeremy and Gretchen's parents. My best friend's mother apparently said that I \"hit it and quit it.\" So the next time I was over at Jeremy's, it was terribly awkward because Lola, Gretchen, and Jeremy's parents were all there. Everyone knew that we had sex, and then just quit talking. \\n\\nLola hates me, Gretchen thinks I'm a \"fuckboi\", and her parents think I intentionally \"hit it and quit it.\"\\n\\nAm I an asshole for assuming what I did?\\n\\nEDIT: I left  a few things out of the original story in the interest of keeping it short. When we met, I was 18, she was 16. When we had sex, we were both a year older (19 and 17 respectively). I didn't just cease communication with her as soon as I pulled out, as some seem to think. I simply meant that it was very awkward between us due to the miscommunication, and she made it clear that she didn't want anything to do with me anymore. \\n\\nAlso, if I could defend myself a bit: Sex is an act that involves at least two people. If she didn't want to, she could have said/let on that she wasn't into it. But I know that she wanted to, because she initiated it physically. I won't get into the gory details but she definitely started and continued to enable the act of foreplay/intercourse. This was also the first time we hung out in person, just the two of us. I don't know about you all, but if I plan on starting a relationship with someone, I probably wouldn't have sex with them on the first \"date\" or whatever you might call our little hangout mesh.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I would like to clarify that 16 is the age of consent in my state. Regardless of your moral standings, I am in the clear legally. Also remember that she was 17, only 2 years younger than me at the time.   \n",

                                 So, I've been speaking to this girl from my college course for about two weeks we never really talked much before. We have been constantly on the phone with each other and we really hit it off. We both talked about the future and our past etc. She seemed really into me at first and we were planning on going out on a date. She then backed off because I am younger than her. The thing is I'm only under a year younger than her, I'm 17 she's 18. Last Friday a group of us went out to celebrate finishing our college course. She was being extremely flirty with one of my friends. Long story short they both kissed and it felt like a massive kick to the balls. Am I an asshole for being mad at her? I think the reason why I'm mad/upset with her is that she knew I really liked her. I'm also mad at my friend because he knew I liked her.    \n",

                 I'm 19, my sister is 32.\\n\\nMy parent gave my car to me at the start of my Senior year of high school as my early graduation present. This was so that I could get myself to school and the like. \\n\\nFinished high school since then, and I'm taking over gas and other fees for the vehicle once I get my first job (if all goes well, I should start early next month). My older sister does not have her own vehicle because she totaled the one(s) my parents bought her.\\n\\nThis year my parents begged me to let my sister borrow my car for work and driving her kids to school. I obliged because I didn't have a job at that point, so I didn't need the car every day. What harm could there be in it? \\n\\nWell, she ends up keeping the car for almost three months. Her husband had been driving it without permission and without a license. He was buying drugs in my car. My dad caught him and promptly took the car. \\n\\nWhen I finally got it back, it was absolutely trashed. I used to clean used cars, and I've never seen such a disgusting interior. I cleaned out enough trash to fill three 30-gallon trash bags. Piles and piles of food and soda cans. Plates with ranch dressing and pizza rolls just sitting on the seats. Food stains covering all my seats, which were almost spotless before. And my car had at least 5 cockroaches living inside. It took hours to clean.\\n\\nI don't understand how she could be so selfish. She showed no respect for a person who was allowing her to use their most expensive object. \\n\\nMy parents, who bend over backwards to make my sister happy, recently asked me to lend my car to her again for a few days. Because she wants to take her kids to Sunday school. I outright said no. \\n\\nI don't feel badly for my sister's sake, I feel badly because I told my parents no and they're the ones who purchased the car. Am I an asshole for that?   \n",

    So, I'm 19 and still live with my parents. I have a part time job averaging about 25 hours a week at minimum wage. My parents will ask me occassionally(as im sure all parents do) to pick up milk or some groceries from the store. I don't mind the chore, I like getting out and driving and walking around. However, what I do mind, is when I give them the receipt from my trip, which contains all THEY wanted(if I get anything for me, I do it on a seperate transaction as to not add confusion to the bill). Then, when I ask to be paid for it, my mother gets up in arms over asking for my money back. She uses arguments like, \"Oh well, I buy you things when im at the store and I don't ask you to pay me\" or \"When I was your age, Id buy my moms stuff because I loved my mommy so much.\", which to me doesn't make sense seeming how I pick up what I need or ask if they want me to pay them for any groceries I put on the list. The thing is, I wouldn't mind if these were just snide comments, but these turn into days long arguments over something like $11. Another factor that may play in is after my grandfather died, he left me a substantial amount of money to help pay for college, which my mother believes she was cheated out of. I already have lent her about $500 with her not paying that back yet, arguing that it shouldve been hers anyway. I feel I should mention my mom is on disability and my dad works full time. I guess, I want my money back, because I know if I don't ask in the moment, my mothers going to think that everytime she sends me to the store that Ill just cover it and end up making my lists so much longer and more expensive since I \"have the money to afford it anyway.\" What do you think here?\\n\\nTL:DR- I want my money back from either lending it to my mom or going on errands, while she believes that shes entitled to them as \"gifts\" or something.   \n",

Me and Chris have been friends for 6years, I'm 19 right now. We originally met in school when we were 13-14 years old. Back then like most boys, we did nothing but play a lot of videogames. We weren't your stereotypical Urkle-type nerd, but more the quiet bunch that played a lot of games and got along with nearly everyone. \\n\\nChris and me were part of a bigger group of 'core' friends. But since Chris and me had been classmates we knew eachother very well. I considered him one of my best friends.\\n\\nBack then I was out of shape aswell, needless to say me and Chris were really good friends and not the most popular in the school. As a kid with low confidence going through puberty, I 'dealt' with normal adolescent insecurities by being the nice guy. ( ~~sometimes to a fault when i look back at things~~ , definitely to a fault, I would let other people push me around )\\n\\n\\nDuring the next two years in school, I, then Chris respectivelly flunked a year in school. Because of this we ended up in different classes, and made different friends. I mostly hung out with my 'core' group, Chris more and more with a new group of friends. We were 16 at the time, still very good friends but hanging out less because of different friend groups. Soon after Chris made his new friends, he became attractive and popular. ( And more dickisch in my opinion )\\n\\nChris would never have time to hang out with me or any other friends from the original 'core' group anymore, since making new friends. This didn't bother me too much, people made new friends all the time during adolescence. \\n\\nI only started getting annoyed with Chris not having the time to hang out with me, when 2-3times a month he would show up to my place after school to drop of his stuff, so he wouldn't have to lugg it around when hanging out with his friends. I voiced once that I didn't like it that he would use my house as his personal locker, but let myself get pushed over since i was too timid and friendly. This went on untill we were about 18. \\n\\n\\nWhen we bothe started uni, Chris said he would have more time to hang out with his old friends now, since he wouldn't be able to see most of his then current friends. ( This always felt a bit fake to me, since it felt to me like our 'core' group got labelled as a plan B, for when plan A wasn't available )\\n\\nNow I'm a different person compared to when I was 13-16. I started lifting weights, grew till I was 1.88/6\"2, My 'face' had become attractive aswell. I started kickboxing aswell. All these things grew me a lot of confidence.\\n\\nThe straw that tipped the bucket... So me and some friends of the old 'core' group were hanging out at a quiet field with a nice view. Chris showed up aswell. ( Occasionally we'd meet when going out drinking/partying in town ). \\n\\n\\nWe sat in a cirkle and I was seated next to Chris. Chris started smoking and because of the direction of the wind, his smoke ended up in my face all the time. I stated this and asked him to either move, or stop smoking. He kinda ignored me and continued anyway. I sat in the grass for another 8ish seconds not really knowing how to make him stop since he wouldn't listen to me. So i pushed him. (We were bothe sitting in the grass next to eachother, this was more a one-armed light shoulder push then a full rage sparta push). Chris just laughed this off, and continued smoking again, he said that the only reason he let the smoke get in my face was because i reacted to it. Even though I didn't feel like I should have had to deal with this shit, I kept my mouth shut for another 15ish seconds whilst Chris continued to keep smoking. My other friends (and I guess Chris aswell) didn't really notice how serious I was with being annoyed with having constant smoke in my face. Well, I bursted, I stood up, yelled at Chris, called him out for all his shit, took my bike and left while my other friends were trying to calm me down.\\n\\nI guess the reason I'm mad at Chris is because he never respected me once he became popular, He would use me as a friend for when he needed one. \\n\\nEven after I became known as the attractive guy in my auditorium, he still wouldn't respect me. I always felt like he looked down on me as a friend. The worst part of this might be that I'm a confident guy, but I feel like a turn into a bitch whenever i stand across from Chris. Like I don't really care what people think off me, or wheter they 'respect' me or not. But for some reason I do with Chris, and I can't get over it. I feel like an idiot just being able to get so mad and even typing a whole story like this over something that is so trivial in my life. \\n\\nSo... Am I the asshole for yelling at Chris (because I guess i'm insecure when it comes to him) or is Chris the Asshole.\\n \\nTLDR: used to be an quiet, friendly, low selfesteem type kid. Had a very good friend who turned popular, and I feel like he 'used' and pushed me around as a friend, without ever standing up to him because of my low self esteem. We sort of parted ways naturally through school. By now I had become confident and popular myself. Was hanging out with some people including that particular 'friend'. He blew smoke in my face and wouldn't stop. I felt disrespected too much, and called him out on his shit.\\n\\n   \n",

not scared of them and mainly line up with Americas laws. My step father has a gun safe in the house and today he told me that he put a gun on lay-by. I assumed he told my mum (even though she HATES guns, and the idea of having a gun in the house.) I said just half-hour ago \"oh so Jack got his gun on lay-by today, thats exciting\" she went off at him and now they are fighting, he locked her phone in the gun safe and has taken off, we do have to toddlers in the house but the gun rules here are so strict that you must have the gun, the bullets, the magazine all in a different safe and the only time you can bring it out is when you are taking it to the range, its not like he would be playing with it around the house anyway. \\nAmItheAsshole?\\n\\nTLDR; step father told me he got a gun, i thought mum knew, she didn't, she hates guns, think they might have broken up   \n",

this girl for about a year, I actually met her when I was going to have a 3 way with my then fwb and her. I also had a friend that I've known for 15 years, and my father and his were best friends. Well, fast forward a couple years after I didn't have that 3 way because I ended up getting black out drunk at the college she went to and forgot about them, and she's engaged to my childhood friend, and she's pregnant. Now I'm a pretty liberal guy, and very open minded. She's very conservative. We're friends on Facebook and she posts shit saying Obama should be impeached and things like that, and I always like the cnn article of 182 things obama has done, and each one has citation. But then today she posted a picture saying something along the lines of marriage isn't about religion, or finances, and it's only about love. Then I posted something along the lines of saying it's wrong of her to sit there and say someone getting married because it's part of their religion, or making it a financial decision is wrong when she expects others to be tolerant of her views on it. She then proceeded to threaten me, and attack me personally. Which I ignored the personal attacks, and the threat because of my respect for my old friend. Then before I respond she tags him in it, and he calls me a douche for calling her on her shit. I responded by saying that I was happy for them (I'm not, she's a bitch and a slut) but that if she expects others to be open to her ideas about marriage she has to be open to others. She then threatened me again, and attacked me saying that my father didn't want me and I'm a failure. I don't talk to my dad by choice, and while I recently quit my job I have no debt, an she has student loans for a degree she didn't finish, and no job. I didn't say any of that though, nor did I post any of the pictures of her I have, nor did I tell him about the tumblr page she used to have that I got those pictures off of. What I did tell her is to thank him that I'm not going to flip out on her, and I blocked her. Then I messaged him saying I'm sorry things had to go down like that, and blocked him.\\n\\nPS I haven't talked to my dad in over a year and haven't seen him in about 2 and a half. He wasn't there growing up, and so me and this friend weren't best friends, but we were still friends.\\n\\nTL;DR Oldest friends slutty fiance doesn't like me, and we got into it. I ended up blocking her, and him, and lost my oldest friend. So am I the asshole?   \n",

 When I (28M) was dating my exgirlfriend (21F) I borrowed $90 from her. I then got dumped for my best mate and lied to for 8 months until a friend of hers told me. I offered to pay her back when we broke up and she said not to worry about it. We paid for each other's stuff all the time and consider it even. Three years later, last weekend, we were at the friends birthday and she tells me that I still owe her the money. Am I the asshole for not paying her back?    \n",

lived with her until I was 19.  When I moved out of her place she was upset that I wasn't going to college and instead moved in with my gf half a state away. Now I'm 22 and she is still pushing the college issue and trying to get me to move back with her. I feel like I should do what she says because in a way she saved my life, or at least made it what it is today, but I just really don't want to go to college or live in the town she is in. I feel like an asshole   \n",

                      I am 16, mixed Caucasian and Japanese, and working in a detail shop. My boss, who happened to be a close friend before he was my boss, likes to make Asian jokes every now and again. I don't really mind and play along most the time: \"Haha yeah keep talking and there won't be an iPhone 7!\"\\n\\nYesterday, we had this electrician guys come get us these sick lights in our new shop. It's like multiple mini suns suspended in the shop, beautiful. Anyway, he probably overhears my boss making Asian jokes and decides to put his own input in now and again.\\n\\n\"Do ya ever have trouble pronouncing his last name? Got a windchime in here when ya do? Ching chong!\" (My dad is white so I have a white last name)\\n\\n\"Do ya want me to find a white guy to work for ya? This Asian isn't even working hard! He ain't sweatin'!\"\\n\\n\"I can't read this. Can't your Asian read this Chinese on this here instruction manual?\"\\n\\nThere were many more. I had earplugs in and pretended not to hear any of this. AITA if I'm mad, even though in a way I brought it on myself?   \n",

lay it out for you Reddit, there is this girl in my class who (we'll call her Anna) asked for my number today in front of my entire group of friends. Now Anna is not particularly attractive, and she has come off fairly bitchy, (note - this is summer school so it is a new class) and is two years older than me (17 to 15). Not wanting to embarrass her, I write it down and give her my number. Now, what happens immediately is she begins flirting, asking me what I think of her, if I want to fix her bra, do I shave (down low) etc. Now this was very sudden, and I wasn't planning on going out with her, (she, again, came off bitchy in the two weeks we've been interacting) so I decided I'd rip the bandage off if she didn't chill out (I told her I wasn't overly comfortable taking about these subjects after just meeting her) so fast forward 2 hours of decent (flirty on her side) conversation, and I decided it was time. I told her I was not interested in having a relationship. (Never had one)\\nNow, she seems upset, and keeps asking to hangout, and I say no to, as it could lead her on, which is the opposite of what Im trying to do. \\n\\nSo tell me Reddit, i have literally no experience in this area, and I'm not sure if I handled this correctly, but am I the asshole?   \n",

at home. My mom passes by my room and I ask her to come in so we can talk about something. The something is purely benign, nothing important whatsoever, when she picks up a check written out to me, also benign in nature. She asks, \"What's this?\" in that slightly rushed cadence that implies at least a little suspicion. I maintain a cheerful demeanor and a humorous tone in telling her \"First, that's none of your business, but second, it's just a check from dad reimbursing me for textbooks.\" At hearing the \"none of your business\" she seemed shocked and said she didn't appreciate that. She's clearly upset but won't talk to me about what about the interaction is upsetting her even after I try to get her to talk about this situation. She doesn't think she overstepped any personal boundaries (I do), but she won't hear any of it. Anyways, the way she reacted makes me feel like I should feel guilty for saying what I did, but I feel completely justified in saying what I did, especially in the jovial manner that I did. So what do you think? Asshole or no asshole?   \n",

If anything is unclear please let me know and I'll try to clarify.\\n\\nI am 23 years old, recently graduated from college, and currently living with my mother on the East Coast (USA). If it matters my parents are divorced and I am not living under my father's roof. Recently my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together in California. This is a good move for me career-wise because I want to work in the biotech/pharma industry.\\n\\nI ask my father for advice frequently but he also gives a lot of unsolicited advice. He says that this is because he has an analytical problem-solving nature that he can't shut off. He  thinks that I need to have interviews lined up in CA before moving there, otherwise I will drain my savings.\\n\\nIdeally I'd love to have interviews lined up before moving but I personally don't think it's realistic. Companies often don't take applicants seriously if their address is on the other side of the country. I did apply to a lot of CA jobs during spring and never heard back from any of them. I was afraid that if I applied to more with my East Coast address it would be a waste. My father then suggested I put down an address of someone I know in CA, but I'd have to be able to fly down for interviews on short notice, which would also drain my savings.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I picked out a short-term lease apartment and he is willing to cover rent and other costs of living until I am employed. We made a budget. I have $8000 in savings that will be used on the security deposit and my plane ticket. The rest will be emergency funds. I do not expect my father to bail me out financially under any circumstances. I am not moving to CA for around a month, but I have started applying to jobs using the apartment's address. My father wanted me to have interviews lined up before choosing an apartment.\\n\\nI fully explained my reasoning to my father and I can explain more of my reasoning if anyone asks. I do understand my father's concerns and I know he's trying to look out for me. I told him that I took time to think on his advice but I am not going to follow it and I would like to stop discussing it. He got angry and told me that was a very disrespectful thing for me to say.\\n\\nMy father thinks I was just too lazy to apply for jobs early because people in my generation have lazy attitudes. He said he felt it was his duty to \"slap that attitude in the face\". I found this very hurtful because I'd applied to tons of East Coast jobs before deciding to move to CA, so I'm clearly not too lazy to apply to jobs. At this point both of us were raising our voices. \\n\\nAt 9:40 during the argument I told him I needed to leave soon to feed cats I was pet sitting by 10:00. He wouldn't drop the argument and I reminded him I needed to leave several times. The cats have special diets and need medicine, so by 10:40 I walked away from the argument, telling him I was already 40 minutes late to feed them. This is especially where I'm worried I was the asshole. But in my opinion it's definitely an asshole move to not feed the cats.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I told my father that when he gives me unsolicited advice I will always listen and consider it. But if I end up choosing not to follow his advice I want him to respect my decision. His response was that this is very disrespectful to him. I ended up walking out mid-argument because I was pet sitting cats with special dietary needs and was already 40 minutes late to feed them. My father was aware that I had this responsibility. I am 23, not living under my father's roof, and not depending on him financially. AITA for choosing not to follow his advice and/or leaving the argument to feed the cats?   \n",

                                                My Mum is all about veganism and organic living and all that. I'm 17 and so still live at home, I can't buy or eat anything she doesn't agree with or she'll flip out. I understand her whole thinking behind it all and in a perfect world it would be fine. But since she has 4 kids and is a single parent, she doesn't have the most income and often borrows money from us. Vegan and organic alternatives of things can cost 3 times the price of normal products. I have always felt that she's kind of selfish for saving to buy the 'right' food instead of just buying a cheaper option and having more money for other things.    \n",

                                                                 So im in high school (UK), ( year 9) and I like to go out locally with friends after it most nights, but my cousin who is three years older than me (16) started hanging out with us. He clearly makes my friends uncomfortable (although they didn't say anything). I also don't like the way they act in front of them. So the question is am i the asshole for going out with my friends and not invting him?   \n",

                                                       I'm 17 years old, and I like this girl who I go to school with, we talk often, but I just plain out suck at conversation, so I found another way to find things to say. One example is how I make alternate accounts on social media like Younow and things to ask questions about if she likes people, or what she thinks of certain things.\\n\\nI use that social media information as leverage in our conversations because now I have things to use when we talk. Does this make me an asshole, is it cheating a relationship in any way? Or is this what social media in intended for, I can't figure it out, but I feel awful.   \n",

                                                       To start off im 17 and in High School (Scotland) so im in my 6th year of highschool and some guy in my year group that i've known for 13 years (7 years in Primary, 6 in highschool) has started following my group of friends, how long i've known him is important because for all of that time, i have disliked him, for 11 years he was a total cunt to everyone, Bullying smaller people, people younger than him etc...\\n\\nSo he has started following me and my friends around in school because he is in the same class as one of them. We have told him to go away: Didn't work. We told him to fuck off: Didn't work. We've sat him down and had an actual conversation and asked him to go hang about with people that are actually his friends (Which he has) and his reply is usually something along the lines of \"It's a free country\" and thats his justification for following us around. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but as I said, he was a dick to everyone, so another reason I want him to leave us alone is the fact that people might think we are dicks for being \"Friends\" with him. It honestly ruins my school day some days just knowing that he's there, I listened to a recent JRE episode and he was talking about not letting people in his life that wont make it better and I agree with that as a rule of life. Because he hasn't left us alone, we have started telling him to fuck off, go hang about with your friends multiple times everyday (3-4 times)\\n\\nAre me and my friends assholes for being a dick to him because he wont leave us alone, is it bullying? I really don't feel like it is. Would appreciate feedback.   \n",

After some games for a while now me and one of my friends (who is probably in his mid 30s) have gone to subway or kfc because it is very close to the ground we play at. He has payed for me everytime we have gone. I thought that this was acceptable because I am not working and I do not get given an allowance by my parents, but my brother told me that this was not. Apparently I should be paying back for the food and offering to buy him drinks back at our cricket club. Am I the asshole?   \n",

My name is Cory, i'm 20 years old, and I currently live in a rough apartment complex. I have been living peacefully on the first floor for about two months until recently a single mother with three bad ass kids around the ages of six moved into the apartment directly above me. For approximately a week, the kids sound like they are intentionally trying to annoy the hell out of me by stomping around like apes. If you have ever had someone live above you, multiply the noise by ten and now you feel my pain. I have tried talking to the mother and explain to her how to control her kids, but that just seem to piss her off. Never tell a mother she is a bad parent, now it seems that it's non-stop play time for her kids. Little does she know I have a 1000W 5.1 surround sound system that I have not put to good use since the move to these apartments. A day later, I cranked up the music about midday, it made the water in my glass vibrate, so i'm sure she enjoyed the booming bass just as much as I. That went on for half an hour or so before I judged she had enough. For the rest of  the day I was able to read my Game of Thrones in silence, but to my disbelief, the next morning was hell. I could literally hear the mother tell her children to play football inside because it was too hot outside. Really bitch? I had to take it to the next level. The blasting of my music lasted for hours at a time during the day, I even gave her a taste of it around five in the morning. I can tell you she did not love that by the banging on my door about 20 minutes later. I told her I like to get pumped before my morning runs. She cursed and purposely stomped back upstairs to her zoo that she called home. Later that day I continued my music festival in my living room for about 2 more hours. It seems she has forfeited and began to settle her children down, but just to make sure I have continued the blasting of music just to put the nail in the coffin. Am I the Asshole?   \n",

                                       I am 17 and my friend is 15 and we spend almost everyday either working out or practicing our sport on our own. I have obtained my license while he is not yet old enough, and he expects me to pick him up and drop him off 90% of the time we go somewhere. He lives about 7  minutes in the opposite direction of where we typically go and I live a very short distance from the destination. AITA for usually making up excuses for why I cannot pick him up? Once I give him a reason for not being able to pick him up he normally gets a ride from his parents anyway! What should I be doing differently? I hate feeling like a damn taxi!   \n",

    Hey I'm 23 years old i have a friend that i have known since i was 4 years old (we shall call him Tim). So for most of the 19 years his family has taken me in treated me like there own, they have taken me on camping trips, hockey games, bought me a guitar so me and Tim could both learn to play. Tim and I were the best of friends but as time moved on we would be on again off again friends mainly cause i didnt like the way he treated me. This is the part I sould have started with lol, for many years Tim had to be the best at everything. He was very arrogant and cocky, he would bash you no matter what. so here is the problem O.k so i have been with the love of my life for now 5 years we are getting married in one week from this being posted. my \"best friend\" claims that my wedding is a big inconvenience to him because he is the best man and he has to throw a few little partys and shit like that other then that he has to just get ready and show up for the day of the wedding and that is all besides a speech. He claims I'm doing this to young and that I am ridiculous for even moving as \"fast\" as we are we have been together for 5 YEARS! Now I do understand that 5 years isn't that long but long enough for her and my self. After he and I had a talk one night about my wedding and I was saying how it sucked that all my money is currently being drained, this is when he said that i should move on leave my woman cause I'll be a no body unlike him who is going to be a somebody. I then turn to him and say, \"after my wedding we are done, I'm sick of you treating me like dirt walking all over me and I'm sick of you being a CUNT!\" then I walked off so AITA?   \n",

stepped out of the car to go in one of the buildings for a second and I was right next to a dumpster and opened my door to throw this bag I had away. This car pulls up to me and tells me to roll down the window and asks why the Fuck I'm throwing trash away in his dumpster and why I'm trespassing. I told him I was sorry and that I was just waiting for my mom and had a piece of trash. I said I wouldn't do it again. He then takes a picture of the license plate and says he will personally make sure the police have me, not my mom pay him a huge fine or serve jail time and drives away. Am I an asshole for that? and can I really get a fine or jail time for that? I'm 18.\\n   \n",

                    I'm going to make this as non-biased as possible.\\n\\nI'm 16.\\n\\nAround a month ago I bought some weed from a friend of mine. I payed ยฃ30 for it and brought it home. Within a day my mother smelled the substance and told me that I wasn't allowed to have it in her house because it's illegal. Fair enough. I took it out to the shed and put it there on her recommendation. A little while later whilst they were on holiday I took it down to a nearby city and smoked most of it with some friends who I met there.\\n\\nThis was whilst my family were on holiday.\\n\\nI came back and since I still had a little bit left I left it in my back and forgot about it. Sure enough, the morning after they came back my mother smelled it again. She asked if I still had the weed and without thinking I said no.\\n\\nA few days later I was searching through my bag and came across it. Rather than waiting for them to leave and putting it in the shed, I admitted that I had it and went to put it in the shed. She went ballistic.\\n\\nI was told about how disgusting it was that I was smoking it and how horrible I was for bringing it into her house again. I was threatened to have the police called on me all as I tried to defend myself by asking:\\n\\n\"How is having pot in the house going to affect anybody negatively. The fact that you've got a little bit of pot in your shed hardly eats away at your mind every minute of every day, does it?\"\\n\\nThis was greeted with more yelling, followed by her calling my father, who I don't have a very good relationship with anyway. He was passed on to me, again threatening to call the police on me. Again, I asked how calling the police would have any positive outcome on anybody. I was told that it'd teach me a lesson. \\n\\nAfter that I went up to my room, logged onto Reddit, and wrote this post.\\n\\nSo I implore you, am I the asshole?   \n",

audio equipment.  Since I'm a college student and don't have a ton of money, this means I frequent thrift stores and antique shops and the like, looking for cheap killer records/equipment from recent donations.\\n\\nThis particular Sunday, I was helping my sister move cities and I had to swing by her old place alone late-ish at night (maybe 7?) to pick up the last of her stuff.  Since she lives right near a thrift store and I'm never in this city, I decide to check it out.  I pull in to the parking lot... and it's closed on Sundays.  But I notice in the parking lot someone dropped off a big pile of shit (clothes, dishes etc.).  Curiosity gets the best of me and I walk up for a closer look.  Records.  TONS OF RECORDS.  So naturally I drive up, load up the truck, and drive off.\\n\\nOn one hand, this was simply someone's garbage that they wanted to get rid of and is technically considered 'on the side of the road'.  On the other, I may have diverted funds that would have otherwise went to charity, had they sorted and sold them the next day.\\n\\nSo am I an asshole?   \n",

important in this tale. I am a sophomore. My dog is a half dachshund, half chihuahua. Looks like a tiny wiener. Obvious questions are now out of the way.\\n\\nSo, my mom and dad are divorced. We go to their house every other weekend. I also have a dog. She usually stays with my mom during our visits.\\n\\nThis particular visit, it's labor day weekend. My mom is going to Hilton Head, but promised me weeks in advance that she would find a place for my dog while she was gone.\\n\\nNow, it's Friday, she tells me she never found a place for my dog, she forgot completely. She got very annoyed when I tried to back out of my dad's visit to watch my dog. \\n\\nShe said she'd put her somewhere safe. I asked if she could at least get a neighbor to check on my dog every day. No reply from her.\\n\\nSo we are halfway to his house now, my mom tells me she's just putting my dog in the garage. I tell her I don't want to visit my dad. She doesn't let me. \\n\\nI come home, my dog is in a 6x6 pen with her crate in one side, the other has two big things of food and water with a towel (for pee, I guess).\\n\\nI am pissed, appalled and upset all at once. There is indeed AC in the garage, but my dog has not touched her food or water the entire three days we are gone. I quickly take her for a walk, then take her stuff back to my room and give her food and water, which I have to coax her to eat. She is very scared and distant.\\n\\nMy mom isn't back until late Tuesday, but my brother is here. He also goes to school with me, so we'd essentially leave her home alone all day.\\n\\nI really did not feel right doing that. She is in no condition to be abandoned.\\n\\nI cut school.\\n\\nMy mom finds out, grounds me from my laptop. She says I should have brought my dog to my dad's, even though he only okayed it when we were halfway to his house. She would not let me go back to her, let alone go back 23 minutes to get her and then drive 40 minutes back to his place with a barking dog (she's scared of the car, my mom keeps her in the crate the whole way due to allergies).\\n\\nI've spent all day caring for my dog, and doing chores. My mom is still pissed, but I don't feel too bad. My dog was in a really bad place.\\n\\nIf I'm not descriptive on something, please tell me.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?    \n",

past.  Nothing serious ever, and no relationship has ever occured (i live in the southeast, she lives in the midwest, but we share similar rave friends... yes I rave get over it).  \\n\\nEverything was fine until this trip.  I arrive and she starts insulting me immediately.  Everytime we're around other people she's belittling me.  Then the second we get alone at the festival she apologizes and tells me she didn't want to hurt my feelings. \\n\\nSo we get two days in and another young lady is kind of into me and tells me she wants to share my bed.  We don't do anything physical but Girl #1 is really upset that we're even sleeping in the same room.  She takes a picture of us and texts it to me (creepy) and then tells me how i'm a jerk for \"sleeping\" with another woman.  We are not dating, and definitely are not in a relationship.  I'm a single man who has no other obligations currently.  Am I the asshole?  \\n\\n(as an aside, this was the last day of a three day festival she got angry.  And i feel like I gave her plenty of clues that she could have hooked up with me if she wanted during the timeframe)\\n\\nPre-Edit1:  I realize this sounds like i'm 18, but i'm a bit older.  So please have mercy on me in the comments. \\n\\nPre-Edit2: or whatever, fuck my inbox   \n",

attracted to the other. I tried to explain to her how I consider her sister my friend. I'm 32 years old and I've known her best friend since I was in the 7th grade. Her mom was friends with my aunt, and now that we're married I see her best friend often. I told her that I consider her BEST friend my friend, and she says to me that \"she's not your friend, she's your associate through me\", despite our history. I proceeded to hit her with this hypothetical that sparked a big argument;\\n\\n\"If your best friend was seeking shelter from a physically abusive boyfriend and had nowhere else to turn. She came knocking on the door, and you were out of town, I would let her in and I'd help her\" \\n\\nShe then goes off on me telling me how wrong I'd be for letting her in the house, and letting her sleep in the house while she's out of town. I never said that she could sleep over, but she jumped right to that. Now we're at each others neck over woman I knew from high school whom I consider to be my friends. She says we're not friends because we don't hang out and don't talk often. I'm trying to explain to her that it doesn't change the fact that I care about them in a friendly way. I don't know...I'm starting to think I'm an asshole just because she thinks I'm an asshole.    \n",

 After having lunch, we decided to have some ice cream for dessert. So my dad (who treats me like a little kid even though I'm 16) asks me and my sister, \"Okay, who wants ICE CREAM?\", and so I don't respond. Anyways, he serves my sister her ice cream, and when he goes to serve mine, I tell him, \"it's fine I want to scoop my own\" and he starts getting difficult telling me that he's going to serve me my ice cream. I keep telling him that I want him to let me do it, but eventually he just got so fed-up and put my cone scoop-down into the container while telling me, \"Don't be such an idiot\". So, am I the asshole?\\n\\nE: Just wanted to make it clear; I'm aware that the situation was stupid and childish. I'm pretty sure that the reason these stupid fights happen at my house is because my dad's a lawyer and will not accept the fact that he can be wrong sometimes.   \n",

             Sorry, this is probably really petty and stupid, but it's just something that's been building up all day. So, I'm 18, I still live with my mum at the moment, and she woke me up this morning and started frantically asking me what I wanted to eat for breakfast, something quick and cheap, like McDonalds, because my brother has to be somewhere soon and doesn't have the time to get real breakfast or anything like that.\\n\\nNow, it's not uncommon for my mum to write things down on random junk mail, so she's got this old bill and is staring at it intently and I ask her what it is, and she just tells me to ignore it and continue texting my brother what I want, so I do, but when she sees me put the phone aside, she starts freaking out asking me what I texted him, did I text him? Like, you just saw me do it, but sure yeah I texted him, I wanted breakfast. \"But breakfast isn't being served anymore, it's over.\" Makes me wonder why she asked what I wanted for breakfast, but I'm like, alright, and text him something else. I once again put the phone aside and she once again starts freaking out. \"Did you text him what I wanted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, sorry, I didn't know you wanted anything.\" I had assumed she'd wrote it down for him before he left.\\n\\nShe gestures to the bill she told me to ignore, her supposed order written down on it I think? I'm still not sure what she wanted me to understand about the envelope. \"He's probably already there! I don't want anything now!\" and then slams the door in my face. At this point I'm crying. I know, probably pretty lame to do, but it was one half due to frustration and the other half from being yelled at like that.\\n\\nShe's been pissed off at me all day. It's not uncommon for her to take her anger out on only me, seeing as how my brother also has anger issues and she's intimidated by him, so she goes for someone she knows won't fight back I guess. It's just been getting me really down all day, because I'm not sure what I did wrong to make her so mad at me like this.\\n\\nSo, I tentatively ask, am I the asshole?   \n",

and asked me for two dollars. I asked her what she needed it for and she said it was for the bus. I only had a 10 dollar bill at the time so I gave it to her. Five minutes later I saw her talking to someone else asking them for money. I watched take money from the guy and walk away. I followed her then she went up to a lady and started talking to her, then took a few dollars from her. So i was like wtf and walked up and confronted her. I told her I thought she had enough money for the bus and I wanted my 10 dollars back. She gave it back to me but she started to tear up. I was pretty pissed at the time so i didnt give a shit and walked away. Am i the asshole?   \n",

middle of September, I got an on campus work study job. I started working in the middle of a pay week so I only got about half of the pay that I would have expected, (The amount of money doesn't matter in this situation). So I set up my direct deposit having 65% going into my debit card, and 35% going into a savings account for books and other school stuff next semester. For some reason, the payroll office canceled my savings account before my first paycheck. No big deal really, I just got about $45 in my debit card and the rest came as a check in the mail a couple days later. So here's where the annoying shit starts to happen. \\n\\nThe day before I get payed the second time, a pay stub goes out online. When I got home I went to see how much money I was supposed to get and when I checked, it said my money was going into a credit card at a bank which I don't have an account with. My first though is that someone is committing fraud and it trying to take my money. This was at around 7 o'clock, so the bank and the payroll office were both closed and I went to bed pissed off. The next morning (Friday), I called the payroll office and what they told me is that my account number was denied and that the credit card my money was on was a student account that was made for me (I was never told about this until then). So I set up my direct deposit again and the lady on the phone told me that the two account numbers were different (Being the one before it got declined and the one i just entered) I checked what I just put in and it was correct. After I got off the phone, I called my bank and got on the phone with an extremely rude women who kept interrupting me and telling me I wasn't making sense. I was told to call back on Monday. Today is Wednesday. I got my other card with my money on it (thank god) and my direct deposit is good to go. However, I just got another email from the payroll office telling me AGAIN that the reason they canceled my information, was because my account number was wrong. I'm sorry if I didn't explain it before because i'm ranting, but the problem I have is, why did I get paid on my debit card the first week if my information was invalid? I was stuck between whether or not the payroll office or the bank messed up. I am leaning towards the fact that the payroll office messed up and just canceled my information for some stupid reason, causing all of these problems. I have been getting countless emails about it and I'm starting to get sick of it. I am about to call them and complain because it is absolutely ridiculous. Am I the asshole for wanting to call them back because they have been messing with my shit?\\n\\ntl;dr Am I the asshole for wanting to complain to my payroll office for fucking up my pay. \\n\\n\\nEdit: Ended up not calling. Figured I would just let it go cause there's not use in getting mad when it's all over.   \n",

parents roof and in with 2 of my absolute best friends. I've come to the realization that I was raised very differently then them when it comes to family. They (Kelly and Austin) we're raised in big family oriented households and so every friend that they had in their lives met the whole of their respective families fairly soon. I however was not raised in such a family oriented way, I never had any friends meet my family unless it was absolutely necessary (going out of town, having a sleepover or what have you, things that required a parent or guardian to be aware of what was happening). Anyway a few weeks ago somehow meeting my now, Kelly and Austin have still never met my family but about a week ago it got brought up and I said I didn't want them to meet because it wasn't necessary. That's not to say they have no way to contact my family, I've given my friends my parents' phone numbers in case of an emergency and vice versa they want to meet and be incorporated into my family. I have met and get along famously with both of their families but then it wasn't really my choice to meet them it was just sort of a last minute thing. I don't really have any reasons for my friends to not meet my family other than it's not necessary or that the parties involved wouldn't mesh like I do with my friends it would be more like saying hello to someone in an office, nothing really there just a social obligation to be nice. Just curious if I'm in the wrong here.   \n",

about 4 month now. A few weeks before we started dating, her father got diagnosed with cancer and she told me that only a month ago and refused to talk about the hole situation with me. 2 weeks ago, she called me in the evening, cried and said that her dad just passed away. so I wanted to come over and hold her, but she told me to stay away and the idiot I was, I stayed home. now she refuses to talk with me about everything again (or even meet me), but I was fine with that, because I thought she might need time with herself and her family now...\\nbut yesterday I discovered that her dad died a hole day before she called me. and on that day/night she called two of her male friends who came over to her in the middle of the night. and the real reason why she didn't meet me, was that she hung up with them a hole lot lately. so I confronted her with that today...\\nfirst she only was curious about how I found that out and then she told me \"that I am just not the right person she needs right now\"!\\nso... Am I the asshole fir braking up with her directly after that?   \n",

Today my parents came home from the store at about 4 PM, and told me that they are going out to eat tonight and have food made for us, I said okay and was fine with them going out, because they deserve it. Then my sister starts complaining to my mother that she doesn't have anything to do tonight and she wants to go to the movies with her friends, but everyone is busy. So while we are trying to figure out what my little sister should do, my dad suggests \"What if I went up and got a movie and you guys played games?\" At this point I kind of look at him like... seriously? Now I have to entertain my sister? And he goes \"What? Is there something wrong with that?\" And I say \"No, she's 11, she has a computer and TV in her room and she can entertain herself for 2 hours. Why do I have to entertain her with games?\" Then my mother comes in and says \"Fine we are just gonna stay here and eat with you, it's too stressful to go out.\"\\n\\n\\nSo now, because of my 11 year old little sister, with a computer and TV in her room, can't entertain herself for 2 hours, my parents can't go out and spend their well deserved time together, and now apparently I'm the asshole. Great.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I'm the asshole. I went out and played games with my little sister for about 2 hours, had a fun time. Parents ended up going out and I apologized to everyone. Hopefully I can fix everything. Thanks guys and girls.   \n",

of my best friends Juicy (27M) and I often buy weed together. Juicy sometimes finishes faster than I do and then buys the rest off me. this has happened 2-4 times, we're unsure exactly. Just now, Juicy asked if he could buy the rest off of me and I told him I'd only sell it to him this one time for a small premium.\\n\\nMy reason for doing it is because I feel like I turn my money into inventory because I want to have that inventory. I should be rewarded (this one time) for the service of often buying inventory and being the guy that he, and others, can fall back on in a time of need. I don't see the point of buying weed and selling it to my friends for what I bought it for.\\n\\nHe is upset because he says that I'm making extra money off of him and feels that is a move that best friends shouldn't do.\\n\\nI see both sides, but need to know who the asshole is...   \n",

Let's say my name is Josh. Make it easy. I'm 16 for reference and a junior in high school.\\n\\nSo this happened tonight. I texted my friend - let's call him Nate - asking if he wanted to hang out. Sure, and he proposes that we go hang out with my ex - who we'll call Abby - and her friend - Jane works. I said \"No\" because I knew it would be awkward for pretty much everyone. Nate and I agree we'll hang out at my house for a bit, and then figure out something to do.\\n\\nI go and pick him up from his house, and as we're driving back to my house, Abby calls him and says she and Jane are buying ice cream from dairy queen and asks if we want any. Nate immediately says \"I'll have a Reese's and Josh will have a chocolate.\" He didn't actually ask me. I tell him I don't want anything. He offers to pay, and it's not worth arguing, so I turn around and start driving to Dairy Queen.\\n\\nWell, they were actually 45 minutes away at a different dairy queen. I drive there, just to not leave them there.\\n\\nWhen we get there, Nate bails, and says he was kidding about paying for me. I pay up, but he knows I'm starting to get annoyed.\\n\\nWe then go into a Target to kill time. It was awkward. Very awkward. Abby and I didn't really talk and it was a lot of silence. I didn't have a good time, and I told Nate, \"I wanna just go hang out with some other friends or at least go back to my house. This isn't fun at all for me. It sucks.\" He says \"Okay, we'll go to your house once we leave.\"\\n\\n15 minutes later as were walking out, Nate gets the idea in everyone's heads we should go play laser tag. I groan and give him an evil eye. \"It'll be fun. I promise it'll be quick.\"\\n\\nWe go to this place - I'll just call it the arcade - that has bowling, arcade games, laser tag, a ropes course, and an assortment of other things. We agree to just play a quick game of laser tag before hand. When we walk in, Jane says we should buy the unlimited pass and do a bunch of stuff. The unlimited pass is $25. They all now want to buy the unlimited pass, and Nate is trying to convince me to pay for Abby, and he'll pay for Jane. I say no, and convince them to just do the one laser tag game. I go up and buy my ticket first. The three of them... go up and buy unlimited passes even though they said they'd do just the laser tag game.\\n\\nWe all go to the laser tag first. \"We'll play laser tag first and then just a few games.\"\\n\\nAs we get right to the front, they see the ropes course, and run off and abandon me, which happened to be the time the door opened to the laser tag. I was first in line, and ushered in by the moving line. I end up playing laser tag by myself and then sitting there at the entrance for half an hour cause I couldn't find them (the place is BIG) and they wouldn't answer they're phones.\\n\\nWhen they do come back, I glare at them, and Nate utters a quick \"sorry\". As were walking out an hour later, we're thinking of something else to do. It's now been four hours. Nate wants to go hang out with some people in theater, since the show just got out. This is where I draw the line. Hanging out with Abby was uncomfortable. Hanging out with the people he wants to hang out with sucks. I hate them and they hate me. It'd be terrible. I tell them, that this night has been awkward and been mostly bad already. I'm not going to hang out with that group and make it worse. I say \"Either, we can go hang out with Simon and Bob (my two best friends), go hang out at my place, or I'm going home. You can find your own way home, or I'll drop you off on the way back.\" He starts arguing and telling me \"It'll be fun.\" I finally just say \"You know what, go with Abby and Jane. I'm leaving\". \\n\\nThey knew the whole night that I was not having a good time, and pretty angry that I was getting stepped on.\\n\\nSo I get in my car and drive home, leaving Nate to get driven around by Abby. This was at 9.\\n\\nAt 11:30, I get a call from Abby saying she got pulled over, and got a ticket for having too many people in her car (she just got her license and can only have one person in the car with her). She blames me since I left her with Nate. But, she had also picked up another person, and it's been 2 and half hours since I left. Now Nate, Abby, and Jane all are calling me an asshole for causing Abby to get a ticket.\\n\\n\\nSo am an asshole for leaving my friend after a crappy night for me, and then being a part of the reason she got a ticket?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                         So a couple nights ago I was asked to help a friend's wife (friends with her too, but making the distinction for later) run reception and registration for a public event. It's supposed to be practice for building up my public speaking/interaction skills.\\n\\nAnyhow, I ended up hesitating at nearly every opportunity to do my job, especially after I made a major fuck-up in charging a speaker's guests for parking. If I waited just a split second, my friend's wife would jump in and do it. So she ended up doing just about everything.\\n\\nAfter we'd finished the main part of the job, I mentioned to her that I wished I had done more. And she sort of told me \"Well that's the job, just smiling and letting people in. You hate it, right?\" I didn't really, I just felt like a fucking cunt. So I rephrased what I'd just said, and she told me that she didn't need my help if I hated it. I don't argue unless I'm absolutely being fucked over, so I just agreed and shut up.\\n\\nThen she sent me downstairs with my friend (the husband) to spend the rest of the event. Yesterday he messages me over Facebook and tells me that he'd prefer that I act like a grownup (I mean I'm 20, so partially there at least, and from a shitass household &amp; social situation that constantly insulted me my entire childhood, I've told him this) and stop whining and complaining when he sends me to help with stuff, especially involving his wife. I tested the waters, stating that I'd like the job better described to me beforehand next time. He says that I should just shut up and take advice like a grownup (btw literally the word he used) and do better next time. Once again I just shut up, because pitting myself against a wife never ends well.\\n\\nI will admit I complain probably significantly more than other people, it's one of the few ways I get relief from stress, if a shitty one. It's half the reason for this post. And I know this quibble is going to become a problem from here on if one of us doesn't address it (and guess what social incompetent me is worst at?).

We hooked up quick, we only knew each other a few weeks before we got together. Well I've been happy at times with her, but i never really get \"that\" connection. What makes it worse, is i believe this relationship is turning toxic. Shes been really obsessive lately. To the point of calling me 76 times last night while i slept(im a heavy sleeper lol). And also telling me she wants a kid, multiple times. So I've been thinking about ending the relationship, but i dont want to be an asshole. K thanx bye.   \n",

                                       My dad told me on my birthday he was going to send me money. My birthday was in September. He called me Monday night and said \"Hey lex, I'm going to be giving you the money on Friday.\" Friday rolls around. \"I'll do it tomorrow at 12.\" My dad lives in Philly and I live in California. It's 10:39 right now so in Philly it's 1:39. I really need to give my mom $20 so she can finish off her bills and I also need to get gifts for everyone but the only day my mom will take me to the store is today. (I'm 17, what you gonna do ยฏ\\_(ใ)_/ยฏ) \\nI texted my dad saying \"Hey, I don't mean to rush you but are you still going to send the money?\" Was that rude? Am I being an asshole for asking him for my money?\\nIt's only $150 but when you don't have a job and it's a miracle when your mom hands you $10, you get pretty ecstatic over it.\\n   \n",

I don't want to watch it because it's almost certainly going to be a trigger for me because my brother was violently abusive, physically and emotionally, and the newest movie will bring all of this back up for me (explained in the description) when I've been trying so hard to move on. I've told him several times to take one of his friends so that they both have a good time but he thinks I should just come because it's only for a \"couple of hours every two years\". Should I suck it up and go or refuse?\\n\\nFirst: There's a reason why I'm not posting this in /r/relationships. They're paranoid and jump to conclusions and they demand everybody break up over the smallest thing. So please, no comments about my relationship because my partner has always been 110% respectful and loving. I'd just like an opinion about this one thing.\\n\\nMy partner loves Star Wars passionately. For weeks he has been asking me to watch the new movie with him and literally every single time he has asked me, I have told him that I don't like Star Wars (I can definitely understand why others do but the terrible acting and retcon distract me from enjoying it) and that I want him to take one of his friends (who all love it) because they'll enjoy it more. He gets hurt and says he wants to share his excitement for it with me.\\n\\nHere's the thing. My (26) brother was very, very abusive towards me for the first nineteen years of my life (I'm now 23). He regularly beat me, pulled knives on me (my childhood bedroom door had stab holes in it because he came at me with a cleaver and I only just got it shut and locked in time), spread rumors about me at school so I wouldn't have friends, screamed at me, encouraged me to self harm and commit suicide, and destroyed my prized possesions. All of this while crying loudly. For nineteen years, this happened literally about three times a week. I am not exaggerating any of this. He did the same to my mother and even blamed her cancer death on me (go figure). He is crazy and delusional and I have cut him out of my life. He is not mentally disabled, but I assume he has an undiagnosed mental illness.\\n\\nI'm still fucked up from this. I'm doing my best to move on but some things scare the shit out of me (I'm very resistant to using the word \"trigger\" because of how Reddit gets angry at anyone who says it but that's pretty much what it is) like if someone gets angry and screams suddenly, if I see a child throwing a tantrum, and if I'm forced to be around things that my brother destroyed. Star Wars comes into this because he destroyed all of our Star Wars toys in a fit of rage while screaming at me and trying to hit me. I can handle myself fine with seeing Star Wars merchandise and references and posters and stuff of course, but being trapped in a stuffy dark cinema for several hours being forced to watch that movie is different and will fuck me up. **He knows the reason why I don't want to watch it. I finally told him the true reason last night (after weeks of saying i didn't want to watch it because i hate the franchise) and since then he's been very distant and hurt but still says he wants me to watch it since it's only a few hours.**\\n\\nHe's upset and keeps going on about how he just wants to share something he loves with me. He doesn't want to go with a friend because he lost contact with them when he started a new job a couple of months ago that means he doesn't have much spare time. I know for a fact his friends would love to go with him and he would absolutely have the time if he didn't see me for one weekend.\\n\\nI know he loves me and is genuinely sad that I'm so resistant to enjoying something with him. I also know how weak and pathetic I  am by not being able to suck it up and go watch it. In my defence I only got away from my abusive brother in 2012, after nineteen straight years of him attacking me three times a week and it's going to take me longer than three fucking years to be completely okay after something like that.\\n\\nI'm thinking of the following options: \\n\\na) I email him more details about exactly what my brother did to me, because at the moment my partner just does not seem to get it even though he knows the overall story, and hope he realises just how badly this will hurt me. I'm worried this will be guilt tripping though.\\n\\nb) I harden the fuck up and go and not complain. This will essentially be bottling my emotions up though and he and I have always sworn to have a communicative relationship.   \n",

                    So first things first, I am 21, working full time in a bank and have been since I was 18. Due to this I am moved out, have a fair bit of savings (Not a massive amount) and a car (Agian nothing great only about 8k but I payed for it)\\n\\nNone of my old high school friends worked straight of school, most of them did nothing for a few years and have only recently started working, a few months back one of my friends asked to borrow 6k in order to buy a car (He currently had one financed, but he had 20k owning on a 16k car) he told me he intended to use the 6k I would borrow him to buy a new car, then he would sell his current car, pay me back and then put the rest off of the finance, and he would be in a much better financial situation then he was, all within the space of roughly 30 days.\\nI was very hesitant about it but I lent him the money and let it go for about a week.\\n\\nAs I ask him how selling the car is going he tells me, his sister is going to pay for the car, but due to her only being 18, she cannot afford to just outright pay the 15k he would have wanted, so instead she would make the payments on the car instead, but it would stay in his name. After a bit of a discussion over how dumb that was, he told me that he would not be able to pay me my 6k back, but he would instead send me $200 every fortnight until it was repayed, so rather then me getting my money back within 30 days, I am facing the realization of not being fully repayed for 30 fortnights (13 months).\\n\\nSo REDDIT, would I be the arse hole for asking him for my 6k by the end of January, with some sort of ultimatum, or should I just let it slide, knowing that maybe he can not afford the 6k and can not get the money off of anyone else.\\n\\nP.S\\nI have lent him 2k in the past to buy a new computer, which he payed me for within two months.\\n\\nP.P.S\\nMy savings was growing rather high, and I had began talking to people about either investing in stock or getting into the property game, and thought the month wait would not matter, but not I completely regret this decision.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nI lent a friend $6000 who said he would repay it within a month, after spending the money, he tells me that he can only afford to repay me $200 a fortnight until it is repayed   \n",

                                            I'm using a throwaway for various reasons. So, with a little bit of backstory, I'm from the UK, am 17, am an only child and currently live with my parents. My parents tend to go out a lot of the time and sometimes leave me alone frequently. They leave me things to cook for myself if they're not going to be there the whole day/night. However, most of the time I have to cook myself something (usually rice and fish fingers or something like that) and resort to snacking alot as a result of not having much food in the house.\\n\\nSo today I've been at home with my Dad doing some school work and playing some games while my Mum's been out the whole day with one of her friends. This evening my dad's gone out to the pub and to a restaurant with his friends while my mum has gone out with her friends too. They also went out last night to a friends house and I had to make something for myself as usual. I was a little mad at them and told my Dad that I wanted a fully cooked meal but he told me to just have leftover food from Christmas. I asked him if we could go to Mcdonalds or something because it would have at least filled me up. He told me he would only go to get one if I paid for it.\\n\\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for getting mad at my parents that they won't pay for me to have takeaway food or at least make me something themselves? I'm not really sure if I'm overreacting at all or they're genuinely in the wrong.    \n",

    Just a little backstory, I'm 15 and had a brother since I was 4, and he's been mean to me pretty much all his life. People always say to me \"Oh, he's your brother, you're gonna appreciate him in the future.\" But it's not like that, when he was younger my dad was over seas, and after that my parents got divorced. We've mostly been with our mom ever since, we go to our dads about 1 day a week. And he's learned my mom's flaws in parents (ex: doing something to her if she won't get him something.) And when he's with my mom he's always mean to her. But when he's with my dad he's always well behaved. Enough with the relationships with my parents, let's talk about our relationships. I've always tried to be nice to him, like giving advice for school or playing a game with him. But he's always mean to me, I always have to live in fear that he will break all my things, yet I won't break any of his things. Even when he gets in fights with my mom he always takes one of my things, or maybe break it. I don't want to hurt him, but somethings I have too (The only times I've hurt him if he's hurting my mom.) He's always disrespectful to people my mom is dating, or friends with. Sometimes he's even the reason the person dumped her. I could go on for awhile about what he's done to me and other people, but I can't think of a time that he's been nice to me.\\n\\nWell I just wanted to figure out if I'm the asshole for not wanting him, in some cases wanting him dead.   \n",

Tonight, I went out with 4 friends of mine. 3 of which I have known for years - one of which I have known for months, only meeting him about 3 times, but have come to become good friends with him. Let's  call him Bill. Anyways, Bill does \"graffiti\". By this, I mean he writes the word ,\"Anarchy\" or someshit in some stupid messy handwriting. There is nothing artistic about it. \\n\\n\\nAnyways, to cut a long story short, I was invited to a New Years Eve party where I only knew 4 people out of about 70. 2 of these 4 people, I hadn't seen in years, and only knew them through primary school. My other 4 friends, including Bill, knew nobody. I knew that Bill had spray paint and markers on him, and to be honest, I couldn't care less if he graffitied some random public property. Bill asked me at some point throughout the night if he should tag the house. I told him no. That was a stupid idea. He agreed. \\n\\n\\nHours later, I had left the party and was on the other side of the road of the house at a park with a girl I had met. We heard very loud, angry shouting, and the host kept calling the girl I was with, asking where she was and that she had to talk to her urgently. I thought nothing of it, as it was already 1am, and new years was over. I thought it was a fight between a few blokes and the rest of the party came out to watch them punchon, as we could see that the entire party had emptied onto the street. \\n\\n\\nMe and the girl hurried back, and as I walked back to the party, I could hear people talking about graffiti and tagging and how someone had tagged a bunch of cars.. Turns out my mate, Bill, had stupidly decided to SPRAY PAINT his stupid tag on the inside of the house and tag a bunch of cars, including the owner of the house and their uncle's car, outside with his whiteboard marker (luckily this was able to be removed easily).\\n\\nI walk back inside the house to get my bag, and as I try to leave, the bouncers, parents and brother and sister (hosts) of the party confront me. The bouncers intimidate me, saying they know that I know who did it. They say they want his name and to don't fuck around because if i lie, they will call the police and find out the truth the hard way. At this point, i am shaking because I had no idea how serious this was, but was starting to realise.\\n\\n\\nThe entire party had been kicked out and forced to go home. I reluctantly (I didn't want to see Bill get in trouble, but I had no choice) told them his name and the bouncers said ,\"Don't fuckin' lie. We are gonna search him up on Facebook and if you're lying you're in trouble.\" They cant find him at first and accuse me of lying, but I was telling the truth. Eventually they find him and at this point I have already apologised about 50 times to everyone around me, saying how I am so sorry for inviting them and how I had no idea he would do such a thing (I claimed that I had no idea he did graffiti, but I knew he did. I thought there was no point in saying I knew he did graffiti, as it would invalidate my word even though I was telling the truth - I truly had NO idea that Bill would do such a fucking stupid thing after I had told him not to...)\\n\\n\\nI continued to apologise as I wholeheartedly felt extremely guilty.. I could see everyone was very upset at what had happened. I was told to go home and I did. All of my friends had bailed, including Bill and I walked home, alone. I messaged the hosts of the party, saying that I was so sorry for what happened and how I would take full responsibility if the police could not contact Bill. They responded saying that their entire family was very, very upset and the mother and daughter were crying uncontrollably about everything that had happened. They told me to contact Bill and let him know that the police will be contacted if he does not go and apologise in person. I messaged Bill and told him what the go was. He said he understood and he was sorry (just to me). I'm not sure what he is planning on doing. He knows they know his name and school, so he'd be stupid to not go and apologise. \\n\\n\\nAm I an asshole for bringing Bill along, even though I had no idea he would do such a thing?\\nThanks, and have a happy new year :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",
       "1369  Hello. This has been on my mind for a long time ever since I did the deed so to speak. Over the summer I ended a relationship with my long term SO. I know for a fact that it wasnt a very good break up for her at all. Just wondering what the community thinks. I am so sorry this is so long. I donโt want to give a half story. Sorry!\\nBackground:\\nShe (19F) and I (19M) had known each other since beginning of high school. We dated on and off. 1st time was sophomore year and it ended badly. Went on dates every weekend, did typical BF+GF stuff [;)], but she didnโt want to advertise it at school. Thatโs fine whatever. After 6 months my friend said he saw her with another guy at lunch. I confronted her about it and she said she didnโt know her and I were in a relationship. Whatever. I moved on.\\nSeveral months passed and we got together again. I made it \"official\" or whatever (dating is confusing) and we were fine. I get a text randomly out of the blue one day saying she wants to end it, but won't give me a reason. She had a 4th of July party the next night that I was still invited to, so I went. Saw her there with her new guy. Confronted her again and she said that he was her 1st love and wanted to see if he changed (Irony is a bitch), but didnโt want to cheat on me. Needless to say I was pissed and we never spoke for 2 years I think? Fast forward to junior year. I left half way through the year to become home schooled. Got an email from her randomly apologizing for everything she's done to me, and wanting to reconnect. My thought process was \"She's matured a lot, Iโd be fine to give it another chance, but no plans on dating\". Well one thing lead to another and we ended up back in the saddle together.\\nCollege:\\n2.5 years was our last stretch. We went to the same college and lived together after our 1st year at the dorms. We fought here and there while at the dorms, a lot of which was her not being able to communicate to me at all. She couldn't tell me if something was wrong, what her opinions were on certain things, or make decisions on absolutely anything. Every argument I defused the best I could. We never had weeks of no talking or stupid passive aggressive shit, just arguments that resulted in her crying a lot for fear she would lose me.\\nI did always communicate if there was something wrong between us. Mainly her inability to communicate, how she didn't seem to care about money, and she seemed to put herself first. I had to help her with everything regardless of what I was doing. I had to help her pack, get on her ass about getting ready to go, and had to help her study, but with very little reciprocation from her. Most things were defused but then we moved into together. Now she had brought one of her horse to college with her. I was against this from the start, but I never argued with her about it. Her animals are her responsibility, and I understand itโs emotional. I was annoyed when she said she couldnโt give up her horse because it means too much to her. I had quite a few pets but I found them all homes, because I know college is a large financial and time burden. It was hard but I did it.\\nMoving in:\\nWhen it came time to move into together I let her really find a place. She had to look for a place to house the horse on the property, because she just COULD NOT drive to her horse, and she would not budge on that fact. I helped with a large list of places, that horse boarding, but not knowing what was needed she had free reign. We ended up moving in to some duplexes on the same boarding facility as her horses (she had brought down another one of hers and her mini-horse).\\nThat was hell. I found out she had no plans to get a job before moving into there and only got one out of luck at the boarding facility on site. She said she didn't have time, while I was working 2 jobs and other EC activities. We had to share a bedroom, and I was not happy. She had to have her massive waterbed (9ft by 4 ft) in a 10 ft by 10 ft room. She could have her things, but I was limited in what my things I could bring. I was technically not a resident there, the landlord was cool with us, but I was told if the city inspects it then I am not there. And on top of that we were 30 minutes away from the campus, with 1 vehicle (mine), and then she brought her dog with her that during the school year we would have to come back and check on twice a day. Our gas bill, with me driving to work alone was $300 monthly.\\nSo shit got bad and we argued about the same stuff. She couldn't talk to me about anything, her still being absurdly dependent on me for everything and just general day to day bullshit. This was not 1 way either. I was told that I get frustrated easily and I curse a lot when I am mad. So I watched my words when I was upset, and tried not to be frustrated, but honestly it was just her bullshit that was making me mad. So it progressed and these fights kept progressing. Nothing breakup worthy by themselves, but all together it was a mess.\\nThe Trip:\\nThen the catalyst. I took a trip to big bend for 2 weeks at the end of summer. I actually convinced her not to go, because I knew she couldn't handle the hikes, I didnโt want to hear the complaining, and I know she was going to be worried about the animals. I admit it was a slime ball thing to do, but I was thinking for myself. I didnโt tell her those reasons but she agreed to it. Definitely an Asshole for that. but I digress.\\nGot into a huuuuge fight the day before. I was still planning, packing etc. and we had to go home (3 hrs away) for a few days leading up to the trip. She HAD to see her family and whatnot. So I got what I could done and told her that we will just have to leave early on Sunday (trip left Monday at 6AM). Then it came. On Saturday she had a bitch fit at me because she NEVER gets to see her family and I wanted to go see my grandparents. We went home at least once a month and we both slept at her families house. I would see my family for 2-3 hours tops at a time. Then Sunday came around, and she was upset because I wanted to leave at 10AM to pack and get things ready, plus go to the stores. That was too early we fought and ended up leaving at 5PM. It was Sunday evening in the bible belt. Nothing was open when we rolled back into town after fighting for almost 3 hours. I just let it go not wanting to be mad at her before leaving on a trip. Next day we ride over there so she can drop me off. There was around a dozen other people there for the trip. She starts going off on the people Iโm going to hate on this trip. Rude, and wrong. I ended becoming really good friends with the ones she pointed out.\\nOn the trip I did a lot of thinking. Only got 4 hours of sleep a night from this. Talked to a few unbiased patrons and came to the conclusion that I should end it before it hits a breaking point. Didnโt want to end it on too bad terms. And she really was a good friend. Get back from the trip and that just escalates quickly. She pulled up and was pissed because I didnโt run down and lift her up out of the truck and swing her around or something (her words not mine). I just got off of a 10 hour van ride and had pulled my shoulder on the trail. I explained but she was still pissed. She then got more pissed that I was waiting on someone. One of my new friends on the trip had forgotten her stuff, so I was waiting for her to come back. She did I brought it to her and hugged her goodbye. My SO believed that I was acting tired around her just so I wouldnโt have to do anything, and I was suddenly energetic around my friend. We argued until 4AM. Next day I went out and found an apartment, and ended it with her that night. Had my bags packed up and I told her I wanted to end it before I end up hating her. 1st words out of her damn mouth were โI donโt know what Iโm going to doโ. She cried and what not and then came all the bs. I was told I was emotionally manipulative, and unreasonable. I did this 5 days before school started again and that was apparently too much shit for her. I was told that I should have done this during school when classes had settled or during the winter break. I merely contested that I could not lie to someone for months about how I feel especially in relationship that was failing. I also contested that there is no good time for a breakup. I didnโt bullshit, or mull around. I did what I thought was right.\\nFew weeks ago we met up for coffee so I could get a few things I left. I apologized for how things ended and how I didnโt want to fight as much. We had a lot of history together, that I donโt think was wasted. She kept throwing in there the guys she was hanging around and how she kissed the bassist of LA GUNS. I donโt know if I am over analyzing or sheโs trying to make me jealous. Iโm not a jealous type at all.\\nNow this is a me rant, but she really did love me. She did everything in her power to make me happy, and she still is, in some weirdly disconnected way my best friend. I had a lot of fun with her in between the fights and I do miss a lot of things. Things were not 24/7 bad between us, itโs just I saw that where it was going and didnโt want to end up enemies. I just want to know am I the asshole here for crushing her heart and doing so right before school started?   \n",

where it goes from here. Thanks reddit\\n\\n\\nFirst some information, I am 17 and she is 17, Her ex is 21 has no job, failed grade 12, no ambition, and they broke up because he was mooching money for alcohol, liquor and other things like that. I am the EXTREMELY jealous type. So a girlfriend talking to her ex is the worst. not to mention she was dating this guy for 4 years.\\n\\nThe other day she said she was in with in a coffee shop with him because he coincidentally walked in while she was there and she didn't want to be rude. I then found out that she actually drove him there.\\n\\nand then she told me that she was only with him because he texted her saying he was lonely and needed something to do and asked if she needed a pack of cigarettes.\\n\\nLast night I found out that she actually texted him first, like 7 times.\\nso not only did she hang out with him which is whatever, but she lied to me about it 3 times.\\nBut for some reason her and her friends think I'm the asshole for being upset.\\nSo tell me reddit, Am I the asshole or am I justified to be mad?\\n   \n",

                           So, my parents got a divorce a long time ago and my father got married again. I wouldn't mind this, I don't live in the same city as my father so I shouldn't have to deal with more or new people (I'm also an introvert). The problem arises when my dad wants to travel somewhere, as he will pick me up and take me in a 4 hour road trip with 2 step-brothers and a son exclusive to her, all of them under 5 years old crying and being annoying, which I even though find very uncomfortable barely manage to ignore. \\n\\nBut it all falls down when I have to interact with her. She is what one would colloquially call a germaphobe, she also has serious problems with her authority being challenged (Once I sat in the front seat for a trip, she flipped out because she wanted to sit there and finally decided not to come) probably because I'm 17 and she feels she is entitled to order those younger than her, she is quite religious and acts in ways to actively go against what would be convenient for me even if it is the best for everyone (once we had to go to a mall and also take me home, even though there was a mall right next to my house she decided we should go to the one closest to our current position, making me sit through 4 hours of watching shopping), all of which I find annoying.\\nI actively do things to annoy her as I find her reactions amusing, mostly unconsequential things, but not nearly as often as she does what I already mentioned.\\n\\nEdit: Well, I realized I skipped an important bit of information. It isn't a happy family, my dad agrees that she is wrong but doesn't confront her because it would be hell for him back at home.   \n",

  So, I'm not just some edgy teen, I'm 19 years old and actually consider myself to be agnostic bordering on catholic. I go to school full time and don't do much else. I never go out with friends or anything. I am fine going sometimes, but other times I am busy and don't have time/have more important things to do. Whenever I try to tell my mom this, she makes the same points: ie you live under my roof, it's very important to me, it's my job to make sure you don't go to hell, sometimes she even cries. It makes me feel very guilty, but at the same time, I'm an adult now and should be able to decide if I want to go to church or not, yeah?\\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole?   \n",

One of them [22M] is homosexual and attracted to me. Honestly, I'm uncomfortable with that fact - not the fact that he's gay but that he's sexually attracted to me. I just want to say now that I have 2 other good friends who are gay and I hang out with one of them a couple of times a week when I'm back in my home town and it's not awkward in the least - because why would it be? I don't give a shit that that friend is gay.\\n\\nMy housemate though: Sometimes when we're watching TV I'll look over and he's staring at me with a distant smile, for example. Whenever I make even a shit joke he'll laugh so loud and stare at me with some proud, longing expression that a wife would give to a husband she loves. It seems like he's always just trying to get attention from me and always seeking a positive response for every little action. Because of this, sometimes when he does little things that he obviously expects me to make a comment on or acknowledge I just stay completely silent. Last week I signed up to a friend's university research project data gathering session, and he came back to the house today telling me that he signed up for it as well. That's fair enough, I suppose, as we're mates to an extent but before I signed up for it he was laughing about it and saying 'no way I'm gonna sign up for that'. It just seems like he's always trying to be close to me and it kind of weirds me out. I like being by myself and to be honest it pissed me off that I don't get to do this thing by myself now.\\n\\nHe knows I'm straight, and he knows that I'm not interested in him in the least, apart from on a friendship level. But it's becoming hard to treat him the same as my other housemates because if I'm too nice then he just starts again. He'll start with the 'Oooh, thanks man, you're so niiiice :)\" or if we go to the shops he'll be like \"our first date, I'm so proud\". Whenever he makes a comment or something that conveys his attraction to me I generally just tell him \"shut the fuck up\" and change the conversational topic (but try to keep it civil on the new topic). It's rarely a direct comment but more often indirect one.\\n\\nAll of us in the house enjoy mutually abusive (in a jokey way) relationships, but I find myself being very minimally more cold towards him than my other housemates - it's as if I subconsciously feel I have to make him learn that there's nothing about me to love and I'm trying to get him to dislike me. However, this is a double-edged sword because one of the reasons he's into me is because I'm a tall guy and forceful / purposeful in my words and actions - he is really into my 'presence' apparently (he's a small guy and kind of obsessed with height).\\n\\nIt should probably be noted that I'm really bad with relationships of all kinds - I find it very hard to connect emotionally with people and struggle to generate and keep meaningful relationships with anyone; even my family. Even conventional, 'normal' relationships confuse and tire me. I'm 22, in my final year of university and haven't had a girlfriend here. I'm good looking and girls like me but don't go through the stress of getting with any and haven't brought any back to my house while we've been living together. Maybe he thinks (or hopes) I'm a closet homosexual and am just repressing my feelings? Although I doubt it as me and my other housemates have common conversations about certain celebrities on TV etc. and how we think they're hot.\\n\\nJust wanted to get this off my chest and ask you guys if I'm being the asshole here.   \n",

He's recently (in the past year) gotten his license, and is now on his Green Provisional (Where we live you have Learner license, Red Provisional and Green Provisional and then your full license).\\n\\nPreviously, I've called him out for creeping up over the speed limit when I'm in the car, to which he responds by slowing down, but protests or attempts to excuse it, each time. I used to think that was just his insecurities about someone chastising his actions (he's got middle child syndrome bad, and it's exacerbated by the fact that his family don't actually relate to him except to tell him when he's done something 'wrong'), and we're working on that. He's also admitted to speeding ('But not by much!') when he is driving late at night.\\n\\nWe've argued about this previously, and he knows I am very wary of bad driving habits (the city we live in has demonstrably the worst drivers in the country, with a young adult motor vehicle mortality rate that is nauseatingly high - one of our local politicians actually likened it to a meatgrinder). Every time, I've gotten so angry with his casual attitude and responses that I've had to tell him to drop the subject.\\n\\nAnd so, today has been... Challenging. Our university is doing a cross discipline theory unit, our lecturer doesn't know the material, so he and I are both frustrated by that. Furthermore, we have to do a group project which essentially doubles both of our study workloads.\\nOn top of that, Allan has been stressing over his personal assignment for this trimester, and is in a position of not really having any inspiration/a non workable concept that he's struggling to turn into a viable project. He's been sleeping badly, and has contacted his lecturers and tutors but then failed to follow up with a meeting or communicate effectively with them about his problems. \\nSo he's irritable and anxious, which he then inflicts on me, to which I respond by calling out his behaviour. I apologise for snapping at him, he apologises and acknowledges his behaviour, we move on. \\nBut today has been one incident after another, which has left both of us rather irritated. \\n\\nWhen I returned home, he'd messaged me to tell me he'd gotten a speeding fine for being 7km/h over the speed limit (want to mention, being under/over speed limit by 5 km/h here is an offense). It's dated from Valentines Day, near my suburb, where he'd gone from work to a local supermarket to pick up desert, and then sped to my house. He has no points left on his Provisional license, and it's a $100 fine. I'm happy to help him pay it off, but it's just the perfect end to an overly shitty day.\\n\\nI said I'd help him pay off the fine, and his response seemed to lack any sort of acknowledgement of the fact that he'd done something wrong. \\nSo I did something very stupid. \\nI asked him to be more mindful about his speed. I really shouldn't have done that. I just hoped he'd change his attitude or behaviour now that he had actually been fined for it. I worried, because it seemed completely bizarre to me that there was no contrition or recognition of his error. And usually he's VERY good at acknowledging when he's been at fault.\\nImmediately, he made the excuse of 'I'm 7 km/h over'. \\nI nearly lost my shit, but told him I wouldn't argue about it with him, that even from a monetary perspective, he shouldn't be doing it, and that we should drop the subject. \\nHis response was 'Forgive me for not sitting perfectly on the speed limit at 9 PM on an empty street on a Sunday that's also Valentines Day.' \\nI told him 'It could be my birthday, my funeral, don't care.'\\nI then told him I loved him and that he should go rest - he hadn't slept more than three hours, and I just needed to leave the conversation because I was furious. \\n\\nAfter all this, he literally has tangible evidence of the repercussions of his behaviour - which has potentially more dire consequences than a fine and a slap on the wrist - and he's trying to justify his actions by making it my fault.\\n\\nNow I just feel kind of hollow and disappointed with his reaction, and I totally admit I shouldn't have taken the bait, I shouldn't have started an argument with him about this shit. \\nI'm hoping it was the shitty day, the aggravation, exhaustion and stress, and getting this crap news on top of all of this, and that he's just operating from a crappy headspace.\\n\\nSo I know I am the asshole, but I just want to know if I'm the only asshole in this situation.\\n\\nTL;DR I'm an asshole, but do I have company?   \n",

                                                               So im in high school (UK), ( year 9) and I like to go out locally with friends after it most nights, but my cousin who is three years older than me (16) started hanging out with us. He clearly makes my friends uncomfortable (although they didn't say anything). I also don't like the way he acts in front of them. So the question is am i the asshole for going out with my friends and not inviting him?\\n   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              So, during my childhood, I had a very abusive mother.  I don't want to get into specifics but for my entire life, my mother has been very manipulative and abusive towards me (emotionally and verbally).  When I turned 15, I went to live with my aunt and haven't seen or spoken to my mother since (I am 19 now).  I have been going to therapy for many years now and have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd.  My predicament is, I have a very good relationship with my dad which is suffering from my avoiding my mother.  My mother is very resentful of my independence and resents it when me and my dad spend time together.  My dad doesn't understand why I can't have a relationship with my mother and often tells me he wishes I could be around her to make her happier.  I don't want to lose my relationship with my dad but I just don't feel like I can confront my mother at this point in my life.  So I ask you reddit, am I the asshole for being stubborn for not wanting to have any contact with my mother?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                              I don't know why I care about this and it bothers me that I spend any time worrying about something so trivial and stupid but here I am. \\n\\nI think it stems from having been the \"push over\" friend through out most of my childhood. I was always just generally someone who didn't stand out, I guess. I had 2/4 high school birthdays where my classmates forgot my birthday and nothing happened aside from last minute throwing something together like \"oops we forgot sorry\". Plus I was vocal about the approaching date, just no one cared. What am i going to decorate my own locker? Lol\\n\\nSo here I am, 25 years old, thinking those days are behind me.\\n\\nI work at a bank where it's 90% women in my department. As much as I hate the stereotype that women are \"cliquey\" that's exactly the atmosphere here. There's currently a 20 year age gap between me and the rest of my department. All the older women operate like the high school girls I hated and I'm never included in anything unless it's the entire department being invited. I've never really cared much until recently.\\n\\nMy office started doing balloons for people's birthdays. I knew the minute this began, I wasn't getting one. So what did I do? A few days before my birthday I made my work instant message status something like \"birthday in 5 days\" so people would know. I get to work the day after my birthday (birthday was Sunday) luckily, expecting nothing and I got nothing. It was fine, or so I thought.\\n\\nNow my bosses birthday just past and my other coworkers birthday is today and they both got balloons PLUS they want me to come out to dinner for my bosses birthday. (Let me just mention that a total of three people said happy birthday to me on the Monday after my birthday, only one was in my department). Also last year I was at a different location for my birthday, got no birthday wishes but was asked to attend dinner for my bosses birthday.\\n\\nI'm asking if I'm the asshole here because I feel like an asshole. I just feel so stupid for caring about something so incredibly stupid!! I think it's just walking past their desks having to stare at this crap that bugs me. It's like high school me is coming back because it reminds me of walking past all the decorated lockers when mine was bare. \\n\\nSo everyone, how pathetic am I?   \n",

    So a friend (26f) and I (23m) started hanging out about 8 months ago. We got drinks after work with a group of coworkers one night, got to talking, and became fast friends. Easy to talk to, gets stuff I've been through and vice versa, and really is just on the same page as me in a lot of things. The problem is that her boyfriend (28m) doesn't like us hanging out. I've done everything I can to try to put his mind at ease but I don't know where to go from here. The three of us have gone out together, we've gone on \"double dates\" with the girl I'm talking to, and I've even gone drinking with just him before. My friend and I have both told him there's nothing going on but she still gets crap every time we hang out and any time I see him I get passive aggressive comments about it. I feel bad for her because she has to deal with it even though she doesn't seem to be too bothered with it and I don't really care what he thinks at this point. I'm not going to stop being friends with her because her boyfriend (I think) is being too jealous. Am I the asshole?   \n",

mom and stepdad. I'm 20 years old.\\n\\nEvery couple months, my older brother comes to visit us for the night. We watch TV, have a drink, and talk.\\n\\nMy family likes to watch movies, so usually when my brother comes over, eventually someone recommends we watch a movie together. However, I'm not a big movie watcher at all. It is difficult for me to sit still while watching movies, and I get nauseating anxiety at the thought of sitting together with my family for the length of a film.\\n\\nSo when someone brings up the idea of watching a movie, I very quickly decline. This makes a big fuss with everyone else. All three argue that I don't spend enough time with them -- and that if I just give it a chance, I'll enjoy the movie. I argue that I don't feel like watching a movie, and that it's making me very anxious.\\n\\nI repeatedly say, \"no,\" but they implore me to stay and watch. I end up storming upstairs and staying in my room until the movie is over. After the movie is over, the berating from my family continues for a few more minutes.\\n\\nThis same situation has happened twice. Am I the asshole for relentlessly refusing to watch a movie?\\n\\n*(As a side note, this is not an issue exclusive to my family. Even with close friends, I don't like watching movies.)*   \n",

They are Christians but I am not. They want me to give 10% of *my earnings* to a god I do not believe in. I still live in their house (I'm 15) so I kind of have to do what they say. Am I the asshole for not wanting to sacrifice my hard earned money to something I don't believe in?   \n",

Doesn't happen every year, but often enough that it doesn't matter to me. \\n\\nSo I go over to my mom's house for dinner and cake. I'd already had a kind of crappy day. My boyfriend was being a jerk, it just didn't feel much like my birthday at all. \\n\\nI'd already gotten my presents from my mom, and my siblings both told me they had ordered my gift but it hadn't arrived yet. NBD.\\n\\nDinner was great, and then my mom brings out the cakes. 2 of them. Uh..what? \\n\\n\"We never did anything for your sister's birthday, so I figured we'd knock em both out at once.\"\\n\\nMind you, her birthday was 4 months ago, not last week or anything. \\n\\nCue everyone singing Happy Birthday to her first, and then me. Cue my grandma giving us the same exact card with the same $20 bill inside. Literally the only present I got on my birthday. \\n\\nEverybody ate her cake instead of mine, also. \\n\\nSo am I the asshole for being upset? I feel like she had 4 months to do cake and dinner for my sister, and could have picked literally any day other than MY birthday. \\n\\nI'm 24, she's 22.   \n",

house, owned, bills are fine. \\nMy grandmother receives her retirement money monthly, relatives visit very often. \\nMy father is ALWAYS between jobs, currently figuring his life out, he's not working at the momment. He's always trying to get schemes for money (not ilegal stuff, but not entirely a good thing to rely on). Spend most of his time at home on social medias, watching TV, hanging out with friends and uncles and drinking beer. TLDR, I think he's not a responsible person.\\nI already help out on bills (internet mostly, and a few supermarket things like food and house's material), which is around 300$ a month. \\nI've been recently asked by my father to help out more (financially, more 200$) at home. I do not refuse these kind of things, so I agreed. BUT, I used to live by myself a year ago (in another state), moved out back due to family issues and study opportunity. Anyway, I wish to move out and live by myself once again (split bills with friends, same and currently city where my father and grandmother live), which would cost me around $900 a month (bills, food and college) or so.\\nThe thing is: Am I the asshole for moving out and \"leave\" my father and grandmother? Last time I moved he didn't react very well, kept a cold relationship with me for doing that. Oh, I'm 24, male.\\n\\nEDIT 1: Thank you all for your honest replies. I'll stat college in a couple months, and I will keep my plan of moving out. I need to live my life and fight my fights!   \n",

I have a car, she hasn't had a car in probably 2 years. I always drive her to the gym, or a friend's house, or whatever to the point that I have to fill up on gas once a week at least, and she doesn't pay for anything. Now that I am out of college for the summer, she's asking me more often to take her places. AITA for not wanting to? I mean, I have no reason to say no other than just not wanting to...\\n\\nEDIT:\\nWe do live together at our mother's house. It's only 20 minutes from my University so I thought \"Why not save money for a few years?\" My father, who is not my sister's dad, pays for the insurance on the car, but both he and I are on the title because he lives in another state and I had a police officer stalking me because the car was still registered in his state. He gave it to me towards the end of my sophomore year of high school. He pays the insurance and for emergency maintenance, but I pay for everything else. One of the conditions though of me having his car was that no one other than me and him, and of course my mother (because she's my mother and I will always respect what she asks of me), can drive it. Also, due to my sister's driving history, I don't really trust it anyway. As for why my sister doesn't have a car, my mom got her a car when she was in high school, then she went off to college and kept parking in places that she wasn't supposed to and kept getting it towed. Finally, my mom got tired of it and took the car back from where it was sitting in a tow lot about to be sold for being there too long. My sister leased a car, got into an accident. Got another crappy car, had another accident without insurance, then got into some legal issues. Ever since then, and after moving back home, she's been driving my mom's car to work and using me for rides. She's been living with us ever since. She also doesn't have any money to buy a car because she owes student loans and for stealing about $1,000+ from my mom's credit card. I'm probably driving her about 40+ miles a week. Alternatives would be Uber, or a taxi, but my thing is that she's making all of these plans with friends to go to all of these places and parties so why can't she get her friends to drive her to said places? Why make the plans and then ask me or my mom if we have the possibility of saying no and then she's SOL about getting to said places that she planned to go to? \\n\\nAnother note would be that my car is 16 years old and has almost 300,000 miles on it. So there's that, in case ya'll were wondering about the condition of the car.   \n",

                          So at the beginning of May I(23) moved out of my brother's house because I became extremely unhappy living there.\\n\\nSo some backstory. My brother(27) lived in another province and decided he was going to move home around Christmas. He bought a house here so he has somewhere to live when he came back. From September to December I lived in his house and did my best to take care of it and even got furniture for the house, a TV, internet, cable, etc. \\n\\nCome December when he moved back everything was okay for a little while, but started to get upset at everything I did. I tried so hard to make him feel at home but apparently it wasn't good enough. He would get upset if I had friends over, or didn't clean enough, which was all I did almost everyday. He never cleaned his own house.\\n\\nThen February comes, he decided to adopt a giant 95 dog, which I was fine with. The problem is he was at work almost 9 hours a day, so I was stuck constantly taking care of his dog. I was a student at the time so I was home a lot. Then the dog started destroying everything. Mostly eating and chewing MY things. I expressed my concern to him and how I felt it was unfair I was stuck taking care of his dog and I didn't want to live my life around a dog. He didn't take it well and refused to get rid of this dog so I ended up moving back to my parents.\\n\\nNow I hear he's telling MY friends how I'm a jerk for moving out on him and he doesn't understand why. That really bothered me and I am not on good terms with him at all now. I tried to be very civil with him but nothing worked.\\n\\nI know this is kind of confusing, but does it make me an asshole?   \n",

                 Some more information, I'm 19 years old and my girlfriend in 18. We do not live together or share any assets what so ever. I've had my car since I passed my test at 17 (I live in the UK). I've grown up around cars and bikes all my life so it's a big part of my life. I've had my eye on a BMW E30 and I recently found one with good mileage and at an affordable price. Any person reading this who likes cars will know my reasons for wanting this car. So I rung the guy about buying it to get more information etc. So I'm going to see the car this weekend. I told her about it and showed her photos, the main reason she doesn't want me to get it is because 'it's ugly'. She also went on to say how it's stupid because it's 25 years old and will constantly break down, I understand her reasoning behind saying it but old BMW's are very reliable and rugged cars. I've been working hard this year in my apprenticeship and I feel like I deserve to buy this car, so I'm going to buy it, but she just doesn't understand why I want it because it's ugly and doesn't belive that it'll last a day before I get problems with it. I'm buying this car because I've worked hard and it is honestly one of my dream cars to own and I have an opportunity to buy it now so I'm taking that chance. We got into an argument about it as I was taking her home from work earlier and I just want to know am I the ass hole for going to buy this car even though she doesn't want me to?   \n",

have some narcissistic tendencies, and I am also extremely introverted and stuck in a pretty socially demanding job right now. I also run my own business on the side. With that in mind, my main question is about whether I'm the asshole for working 60+ hours a week and not wanting to have to be around extended family members on weekends when I finally get time off (note that I work about 50% of weekends)? More specifically, I have admittedly \"plotted\" to not be home when I knew relatives would be coming over our house, because I didn't have the energy to socialize and I wanted to go somewhere where I could just be alone. If I stayed home but in my room, my parents would be even MORE offended, because then it's obvious that I'm home and avoiding the company. But even with my leaving the house, they're STILL offended!\\n\\nI'm perfectly content with only seeing these relatives on holidays. My parents insist that I should make a concerted effort to see these relatives on a regular basis and that I should intentionally stick around when I know we're having company over the house, that it's rude not to, and that these relatives have now \"caught on\" that I'm conveniently never home when they're here and they're \"hurt\" about it.\\n\\nI think it's freaking ridiculous. I am 30 years old. I pay rent to live here. Yet apparently if we have company here it means I MUST be around for it for at least part of the time, even if I didn't invite them? Am I the asshole?   \n",

serious ideological difference.\\n\\n I am taking an online course over the summer. The material is fairly easy, but it takes a lot of time to do. Because it is summer and I still want to have a social life and some leisure time, I have been trying to figure out how to minimize the amount of work I do while still learning the material and getting an A in the class. However, my mother thinks that this idea is terrible as I should be putting 100% of my efforts into every thing I do, and that the idea of trying to calculate how much effort to put in to \"scrape by\" is just lazy, and won't fly in the \"real world\".\\n\\nAlso I feel like she is trying to micro manage my schedule, and the fact that she gets an email with a grade report every day just makes it worse. \\n\\nIs this a legitimate problem, or is it just a petty teenage gripe, and who do you think is in the wrong?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My dad and 2 brothers have been working at turning our basement into a man cave for when friends come to visit, so that theyโre not hogging the TV or making a mess of the living room. Weโve all worked together to paint, sand, and tile and now weโre at the point of getting the entertainment for this area. The Man Cave is, in theory, for everyone but in reality I will never use it. I have a nice TV in my bedroom, and am almost never home to use it as it is. When I do hang out with my friends itโs literally never at my house. This is a thing for my 2 brothers to take advantage of, when their friends come over to watch a sports ball game or whatever. \\n\\nStill, even though I will not be using it I both offered and agreed to contribute my Xbox One to the project so that they can play their games and watch their shows. All thatโs left is acquiring TV, about $600-$1000 is what theyโre expecting to spend on a decent one. Well, now they (And by โTheyโ I mainly mean my dad) is trying to get me to go in about $200 on the TV. Iโve tried explaining that my contribution was the Xbox and games which I could have easily sold for more than that amount (Itโs the Halo 5 Edition) and do not intend on contributing any cash. Aside from the fact that shelling out $200 would destroy my entire 2 week budget, which is tight in the best of times, I will not be using this area at all. I did not need to just give them my Xbox and games, and am getting rather pissed off at being pressured into helping with the TV as well. I get that splitting it 4 ways is easier than splitting it 3 but its money that I just donโt need to spend on a luxury like that. \\n\\nBut now Iโm wondering; since this is technically a Family Project, Am I The Asshole for not wanting something towards the TV? \\n\\nEDIT: Additional Info\\nI'm 26 Years old and living at home. I only live at home because most of my income goes to helping with household expenses, though some of it is cultural as well. \\nI bought the Xbox and the TV in my room with my own money, the TV was purchased years ago. \\n   \n",

My cousin and I, both 20, were planning a trip to go a gaming convention 5 hours from where we live. After planning, I told him to buy the tickets for the convention for us. He then invited other people to the gaming event that were already there. In total, we would be 6. \\n\\nMy cousin and I then planned for him to drive us to the location after I finished working at 3 pm that Friday, so we would get there at 8 pm and have Saturday to do whatever we wanted and then the gaming convention on Sunday.\\n\\nWe then booked and airbnb for a total of 500$ for the duration of our trip that we would split 50/50. \\n\\nHe started talking to one of the girls coming to the event that he invited and fell in love (making it simpler than it truly is). He then asked me if it was ok to go to the event Friday morning to go see her. I said \"ok\", even thought booking a train would cost me 50$ and I would come at 11 pm to let him have the day to have a date, so I booked a train (nonrefundable ticket).\\n\\nI then proceeded to ask him what we would do on Saturday and he said we would go to an amusement park with all his friends. (Just a little note: I am really an introvert and I have a lot of difficulty socializing with a group). So hence a cousin trip became a group trip. I felt like I would be left out at all occasions due to my awkwardness and inability to socialize. I also felt, since he was in love, he would leave me out and put all his attention to this girl. I proceeded to tell him about what I felt and how if he also tried to make me be liked by his friends, he wouldn't enjoy the trip as much as if I wasn't there. \\nMy cousin then told me if I didn't want to go, I shouldn't, but he would want me to go. \\nI decided not to go, letting him go with his friends. I haven't spoke with him since.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not going with my cousin to this convention?\\n\\n   \n",

                                                 I'm moving into my first apartment next month. I am 18 (almost 19) F, and I have three roommates who I think are 20ishF. We're all college students. Our apartment is a 4/4, so we each have our own bedrooms and bathrooms. All utilities are included in our rent except for electricity, which we split four ways and is usually very low from what I've heard. Two of the girls currently live there; me and another girl are replacing two other girls who are moving out.\\n\\nOne of my best friends \"Kayla\" is living in a dorm this year. She is working at a restaurant on campus, and needs to come up the week before school starts for job training. However, the dorm housing people didn't approve her request for an early move-in, so she doesn't have anywhere to stay for the four days before the dorms open. Naturally, I told her she was welcome to stay with me. I thought nothing of it since the only spaces I share with my roommates are the kitchen and the living room, and Kayla is incredibly shy so she won't be coming out there much anyway.\\n\\nMy roommates and I have a group chat that we made so we can see who has what for the apartment, decide what we still need, that sort of thing. A few days ago I texted the group chat and let them know that my friend Kayla would be staying with me from X date to Y date (four days).\\n\\nLater, one of my roommates \"Jordan\" replies, and her tone sounds really pissed off. It's probably pertinent to note that Jordan is one of the two who already lives in the apartment. I'd copy the whole text, but it was really long and pretty convoluted so I'll sum up. She basically said that that isn't the way we run things in the apartment, that we always get the other girls' permission before having guests, even if it's just for one night. She said she wasn't comfortable having a stranger in her home and asked me to tell Kayla she wasn't welcome to stay. The other two girls didn't say anything.\\n\\nI texted Jordan outside the group chat and told her that I wasn't going to uninvite my friend who needed a place to stay. I said I understand her concerns, and if I had someone who planned to stay longer than a week or so I would get everyone's approval first, but that I don't think I need her permission to host a guest in my bedroom for a couple days.\\n\\nJordan replied and brought up the electricity bill, and that she thinks it'll skyrocket with one more person staying there. (For four days?? I seriously doubt that, but I've never paid an electricity bill before so that's something I admit I'm in the dark on.) She said that if I insist on having an \"unwelcomed\" guest, I should pay more for the electricity bill that month. I told her we could talk about it when I move in in two weeks and didn't respond anymore.\\n\\nAITA for inviting my friend to stay in my room with me? I didn't think there was any way I could be since I have my own space, but now I'm not so sure. Is asking permission for every guest excessive, or is my roommate right? Should I offer to pay more for the electricity?   \n",

I hated (And still hate) his guts, but was too scared to tell my teachers what was going on at home.\\n\\nMy dad eventually developed dementia, likely brought on by him drinking himself into it. He's had it for close to 10 years now (He was in his 50s when he was diagnosed) and my mom took care of him before she died. She did get POA over him, but she gave it back to him when she thought he had \"got better.\" (Yes, I knew that was fucking dumb. I miss her, but WTF?)\\n\\nI thought he had medicaid. So, my plan was when his condition worsened I'd stick him in a nursing home. However, I don't know when exactly, but he was switched to medicare because he (Or my mom, again I'm not sure when nor is anyone in the family) had allowed too much money into his bank account. That money sure as shit wasn't there when his condition worsened last year. I couldn't find anything to tell where, exactly, he had blew his money to. I was able to get him to give me POA, but at this point it was too little too late with nothing but a nicely worded \"Tough shit\" from the social worker who was helping me.\\n\\nI have told my mom's side of the family that I don't want to take care of him and that I, quite honestly, don't feel a shred of sympathy for him and they offer verbal support and say they don't blame me one bit. My dad's side, however, says I'm \"morally obligated\" to take care of my father regardless of how he treated me growing up (They also say he couldn't help the drinking nor the abuse since it's \"in the genes\") and that I'm a disgusting human being for not sympathizing with him for (probably) putting himself in this condition, occasionally saying if I don't I will have \"Failed my mom\". So, are they right? AITA?   \n",

I (29f) have a friend (45f) who I met back in 2007 as she hired me. I was an exemplary employee and we were friends that respected the work/boss boundary. We haven't worked for said company for years, but we stayed close since. She's seen me work my ass off during my twenties. Despite the age difference, she's never had her financial shit in order. I have ALWAYS made substantially less than her/then husband. She borrowed $40 during a time when I could barely afford to eat because she really needed it. Because of the petty amount (albeit I needed it), I didn't mention anything... until years later when she was bragging about how she pays everyone back. I just mentioned it out of principal. \\n\\nShe started working for a large finance company and gained the employment by a referral. She recommended me and I was first interviewed in 2008  before the global economic crisis mandated hiring freezes on the finance sector. I didn't get the job, but in all fairness, I didn't have experience. I ended up getting into banking two years later and worked my ass up into a lending role. Back in 2014, I applied on her recommendation. This was while I had banking experience (asset), but not yet lending. I was passed in favour of a candidate that did have just a little bit more, but was told it was a very difficult position.\\n\\nSometime last year, I was doing better financially. Same friend has always been poor at managing her money (she makes about 20k more than I do, but with similar expenses). I wanted to go on  a weekend trip.. she desperately wanted to go but couldn't afford accommodation but said she'd chip in with food. I was OK with that. We went shopping for groceries and she started loading the cart excessively as though we were there for a week. I didn't moderate her because she said she'd pitch in for groceries. The entire weekend came and went, and she didn't spend a dime but took money out for activities for herself. I was perplexed, and followed up when we went home. I was a bit aggressive about it because I felt exploited. She felt really bad about her behavior. She paid me back (not what I was expecting). Time goes on, and I let it go.\\n\\nI quit my job after carefully saving up living expenses for a year. I took a job that an old contact sold me on. Completely based on lies. Staff is absolutely terrible and toxic. I get bullied and alienated. Friend knows this and is excited to tell me mid June that same company is hiring. By July I haven't heard anything, but she reassures me that they're just busy. I feel like an asshole, but don't ask her specifics by mid July. I just vented that with everything going on at my new job, that I was feeling very discouraged that I hadn't heard from them. I was on the receiving end of some bad news that affected me economically and I briefed her on that. During this time, she hits me up about three different times for money. I lent her $100 with the expectation that I'd get it back on 07/29 (Payday). The other two times, she found other arrangements before I could get back to her.\\n\\nToday I decided to touch base with her to simply ask her thoughts if she thinks I should touch base with the recruiter that I originally spoke to briefly or if she thought it would be too aggressive for me to follow up in person with the hiring manager that might recall that I was passed over. I was feeling very confused, because the job requirements cite one year of data entry experience and a highschool diploma. I am an excellent candidate and knock off everything they're looking for, including assets.  She hasn't paid me back the $100 that she said she'd pay back on the 29th. So I thought that I wasn't being a douchebag with disrespecting her boundaries since it would seem like she clearly didn't have an issue with violating mine.\\n\\nShe responds back that sorry, they hired someone... maybe talk to the recruiter, she says, as per my original query. \\n\\nI can't help but feel pissed because she knew how desperately i was looking to quit my job.i only stayed there so I don't have to account for a failed job experience. I feel it's reasonable to keep your friend informed not only about when they started interviewing, but more importantly that they had hired someone. I'm not sure if those points are valid, or if it's the fact that I've lent someone money whose breached my trust with money. Kind of like.. well, you don't respect me, so why should I respect you? \\n\\nAm I being the asshole here for feeling like I've been wronged? Would I be the asshole for calling her out on the fact that she sat like a waiting duck with Intel while I was going through hell? \\n\\ntl;dr AITA for being mad at my long-term friend for keeping me out of the loop for a job that she referred me for when she knew i was holding out to quit my job?   \n",

cringe-worthy, awkward, and uncomfortable as you could possibly imagine.\\n\\nWe'll call him Jay. 23 y/o male. I'm 21. Our background is that we met at a bar and I impulsively moved him in at the beginning of July. We began feeling like we didn't really click, in the end, and we both came to acknowledge that. I broke us up about a week ago.\\n\\nJay went through my phone after we just had sex, and read all the text messages I made to a few different guys hours prior about how I was trying to plan how I spend my free/fun time in the long run/course of the next whenever.\\n\\nI've only slept with one guy once since we broke up, and I told him that, but he asked me before storming out if fucking me was going to prevent me from sleeping with other people, despite the fact that we openly know we're not compatible with each other in many, if any aspects of a tender, nurturing relationship.\\n\\nHe told me he felt used, but I was the one that made the ground rules that we as free individuals can choose who we want, when we want, as long as neither of us brought them back home with us to fuck in our bed, which I hadn't done.\\n\\nThat was our only boundary that we agreed on.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I know I'm at least 50% asshole, because I'm aware that you really shouldn't sleep with your exes, especially when they're hyper emotional, but I just feel like in order to avoid being a hypocrite and breaking my own house rules, to take him when we're both needy.\\n\\nEdited: More detail.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Last night (as of this post), my girlfriend of six years (22) and I (M/23) were getting ready for bed when she was bringing up buying herself a used car. She looked at me and said \"Will you help me buy a car?\" I said \"How?\" She replied, \"Just help pay for it.\" \"How much?\" I asked. \"All of it.\"\\n\\n             Now, before I continue, I should also make clear that our relationship is not that strong. We fight almost all of the time. In fact, almost all of our fights end with her threatening to leave, so because she does this often, I usually reply with \"Fine, go ahead,\" or something along those lines. I should also note that she makes more than I do, but she has more bills to pay. So, continuing, I said, nicely, \"Babe, you know I can't give you all of it.\" I thought she was just joking and she'd say something like, \"Yeah, I know,\" but instead she asks, \"Why not?\"\\n\\n          I could hear her tone change. I respond kindly, again, \"Because I just can't give all of it. I can help a little.\" \"What do YOU need it for?\" Her tone becomes a little more belittling. I believed she was taking a shot at me for not having as many bills as she does. I was really astonished, because she's been hounding me to save my money and not spend it on anything, big or small. \"I need to save up for the semester coming up. Babe, you can't have it all.\" To save time, she goes on a tirade about how after six years, people would think I was being irrational for not giving her all of my money. I argued differently. Finally, she ends it with, \"I was just testing you anyway. I wanted to see if you would and now I have my answer.\"\\n\\n            I lost my shit as much as a normally passive person would. I said, not shouted, \"Are you kidding me? You know our relationship is pretty rocky, why would you test it so recklessly, if at all? You're the one who told me to start saving my money, so why would you expect me to give it all to you? I would if it were a dire situation, like getting kicked out or medical bills.\" \"It doesn't matter,\" she said, \"I have my answer. I can't imagine being with someone who wouldn't do all that they can for the one their with AFTER SIX YEARS.\" We then argued about who was in the wrong. We stopped and she laid down facing the other way, and I did the same. She shut off the TV and we fell asleep without saying a word. SO, if I'm the asshole, please let me know and I will grovel my way back into her good graces.   \n",

One of the guys on my shift is much older than myself (he's 62 I'm 29) and try's to blow a lot of my direction off.  \\n\\nThis is mainly in the case of safety violations, and to an extent I can imagine his issues (I know that safety was not as much of a concern when he was my age, and I can imagine its not easy having someone less than half your age be your boss). \\n\\nThe other day he completely blocked a fire extinguisher, a huge OSHA violation.  When I brought it to his attention his response was \"if there is a fire I'm just going to run out of the building\" and then he drove off.  This is a typical response from him and I have yet to do anything serious about it.\\n\\nSo I took him aside and told him he needs to work with me, \"I can't keep letting this stuff slide\". He got upset and told me that if I can't take a joke then \"fuck me\". \\n\\nSo I sent him home.  Now I feel awful lol. \\nAITA?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

She went over a friend's (22/m) house to watch wrestling while I was at work. Normally I'm cool about it, her best friend is a guy. Anyway she hungout there for awhile and they always text and whatnot but a few weeks ago, she told me that he got drunk and said he \"should've fucked her in high school so he'd have bragging rights since she is hot now\". I for one got livid and told her I didn't like her hanging around him, but she still went last night and today I asked her to stop all contact with him. AITA?   \n",

                      So I am now a senior in high school and my dad no longer wants to drive me 30 minutes everyday to the private school he's making me go to. He tells me I need to get my license and accept responsibility for myself now because I am an adult. He says I should be driving just like everyone else my age is and he shouldn't be driving a 17 year old around anymore... I told him I don't like driving as it makes me very anxious and nervous and tense (probably because of the bad car accidents i was in when i was a kid) and it also makes me very on edge for the rest of the day. I've practiced driving a bunch but i really hate doing it. I'd much rather just take a bus or walk but sadly there's no way to do that in this case scenario. I'm not sure what else to say so if there's any other info needed feel free to ask and i'll answer your questions.   \n",

Me(M19) and Nicole(F19) were on a trip with our classes to another country. Our classes stayed in the same hotel, for 4 days and 3 nights. Boys for themselves, and girls for themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNicole and I had known each other for a few months. She had just moved to our school and we became good friends in a short time. Nicole has a boyfriend, Jeff(M21), who's a very jealous type, but chose to trust that I wouldn't hit on(flirt with) Nicole. I wasn't interested in her anyways. Only as friends. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo at this trip, everyone got drunk, day and night, including me. But Nicole doesn't drink. So she was sober the whole time. She would lean up against me at night when we went to a mall or restaurant to eat. As in, her back, tightly up against my front. Often. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery night, Nicole would come into my room. She would lay on my bed, and I on my roommate's bed. He would always be out partying, so we had the room for ourselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery time Nicole left my room in the morning, my classmates would see her leave, so they're my witnesses. As their rooms were right next to mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last night, I threw up, drunk and dizzy. We both lay on the same bed. And she moved her hips forward and backwards, kinda humping my left leg. I held my hands around Nicole and put her on top of me. And she would, willingly, keep moving her hips in motion around my crotch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNicole leaned forwards at the same time so our heads would be right next to each other, while still moving her hips. I didn't make the move, to go for it. Nicole then got up and repeatedly said \"I can't do this, I have a boyfriend\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJeff called her while she was in my room, Nicole lied to Jeff and said she was in my room, so she could help me because I threw up and was dizzy and so on. She would then leave the room. We didn't tell anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast forward almost 6 months, Nicole chose to tell Jeff about what happened. But Nicole told a different story, that I tried to rape her on the last night, but that she managed to lock herself in the bathroom of my hotel room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew Jeff, but we were only aquaintances. So I choose to travel almost 50 km to meet him, alone, and tell Jeff the truth. But before I managed to finish my first sentence, Jeff hit me. And started stomping my face while I lay on the ground. Spitting too. I didn't fight back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm 190 cm. Strong build. I could easily eat Jeff, who's short, tiny, and weak, but I didn't. I'm kind of a pacifist and also I felt a bit guilty. But I feel like his anger should've gone towards Nicole, and not me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter he left, I called Jeff. Told the truth. He acted like he believed me, and said they weren't together anymore. But after almost a year, I saw them, still together. I don't care that they are together or what not. I just feel bad for him. Nicole clearly has Jeff around her little finger. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm just pissed that I took a beating and he didn't get anything back. I can easily get my revenge. But I'm also kind of a pacifist, so it's a bit of a struggle, I guess. He has cousins from my city, but they don't dare to say anything to me, because I have people behind me, whom they are scared of. Jeff didn't knew this before he beat me. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter I took the beating, one of my boys threatened Jeff and he got scared. But I said to my boys that I don't look for revenge. My cousin then chose to speak with Jeff, and he cried this time over the phone. Scared. He isn't man enough to travel almost 50 km to meet up, in my city. I told my cousin not to do anything about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the whole situation, a boy, Sam(M20) from the same class as Nicole, came and told me that Nicole kissed him on his cheek before the trip. Sam told Nicole that he has a girlfriend, and that he did nothing wrong there (when Nicole kissed him on the cheek). Sam tried to confirm to me that Nicole is bad, and not me...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. And sorry for the bad English, it's not my native tongue. Feel free to ask any questions. If you didn't understand a part of the story, please say so, so that I may try to explain it a bit better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole? I just want this cleared up for me, so that I maybe might feel a bit better with myself. (I feel like this should maybe be posted in /r/offmychest?) Thank you.   \n",

So after 1 and 1/2 weeks of empty promises of promotions and an actual promise of a raise I decided to leave still. It was well established that my last day would be this last Friday, but last Sunday my boss told me I had to work Saturday because that's the rest of the pay week. But I told him I had other obligations, (I saw friends I haven't seen all summer). I belive he was milking me for days because he couldn't find a replacement. \\n\\nYesterday on Friday we were clocked out and he said \"4 o'clock tomorrow\" and I said I told you today was my last day. He continued with \"no it's not, you are working tomorrow\". I again said no I'm not I have shit to do. He said \"I have a replacement next week not this week\". Side note the \"replacement\" is just a prep cook that took the weekend off. I said that is not my problem I gave you two weeks to find a replacement that's why I put in a notice. He got so angry he told me \"If you do not come in tomorrow I will fucking destroy you\" I said whatever and turned around to leave. He then asked if I was coming in at 4 again, and I yet again said no. This made him livid so he followed me out and stood in the door and screamed at me until I was 2 blocks down the rode walking. He called me a weak faggot, screamed \"THIS IS THE REAL ME\" and told me \"he would destroy me\" yet again, among other things. \\n\\nAITA for not just coming in Saturday or am I justified because I worked my 2 weeks, and I shouldn't have to work for him because he is definitely an asshole. \\n\\nP.S. I'm 16 and he's like 30   \n",

                             I'm in education, a senior at university. Recently I was placed for this semester after asking for \"something within a couple miles\" of the university (since I'd have to commute on foot).\\n\\nUnfortunately, they placed me in a relatively high-crime neighborhood which is known (among my generation, not so much those above it) as a place not to be around after 3pm (especially around the local high school...which is exactly where and when I'd be).\\n\\nI'm a scrawny white guy, and for the record the neighborhood *is* primarily nonwhite- not that this matters; I've worked in primarily nonwhite communities before and had zero issue.\\n\\nHere's how the conversation went:\\n\\n&gt;School: Your Fall 2016 fieldwork placement will be in the [redacted] school district for your observation hours. Someone in the district will be contacting you soon with the information of where and with whom specifically you will be working with.\\n\\n&gt;Me:  are there any options that, given that I stated I have to travel there on foot, are a) closer, and/or b) NOT in such a bad neighborhood?\\n\\n&gt;I hate to be picky, but most people who live around here know not to be in [town] around when school lets out. And I'm primarily concerned with my own safety here.\\n\\n&gt;School: I am here to provide you with directions which will allow you to take public transportation to get to the schools in [town] school district. I hope that, following your experience in [town] school district, along with guided reflection from Professor [name], you will have a matured professionalism in regards to working with high-needs adolescents.  Until then, please know that it is my responsibility to ensure that all teacher candidates have clinical practice in a diverse array of school settings according to NYSED requirements.\\n\\n&gt;Me: Fair enough. I hope that you did not take my concern as a racially motivated one, but rather one motivated by statistics and personal experience. Had [nice black neighborhood] experienced the same issues when I was placed there previously, I would have voiced similar concerns.\\n\\nI grew up in Queens, so I'm not exactly soft. But this school has been known to have racial and gang-related incidents in the (fairly recent!!!) past. I'm not a racist- but I'm not a moron either.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?\\n\\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I'm 21 years old and am *still* mistaken for a high (or even middle!) schooler by pretty much everyone.   \n",

It's a lot of fun. Anyways, there's this girl who is very very sheltered. And any time someone curses or says something obscene, she lectures them.\\n\\nAnyhow, I accidentally hurt myself while building a robot and naturally I said \"shit\". She promptly says \"you shouldn't say that, that's a bad word\". This girl is 16 and I'm 17 for reference. I just was kinda frustrated with her and was like \"you're in highschool, how are you not used to this?\"\\n\\nWas this a dick move? If so, please let me know how to handle it. She won't even let me say piss. And it's pissing me off   \n",

                                                                                                                       I'm 18, just recently graduated High School, and I haven't started work nor college yet (Work starts this week.) He's 16, and I love him, but we oftentimes have it out verbally. \\n\\nWhat usually ends up happening is that we'll go a week or two getting along, and then he does something or gets an attitude about something that absolutely drives me mad. Then, inevitably; we end up fighting about it.\\n\\nHalf the time I feel that I'm not in the wrong. What usually incites these arguments is the fact that I tell him what to do, even when my parents end up saying the same thing I do in the long run. No matter what it is, if it comes out of my mouth he's going to have an attitude about it.\\n\\nWithin the past 2 days, we recently had to mow. I usually do a good bulk of the mowing, and he gets the trim. That's how it's been for a long time and it works well with both of our schedules. So I let him know that the mowing needs done (Yesterday) and he goes out to do it. Instead of mowing the trim however, he mows over everything I already did; saying it wasn't done (Even though you could very clearly see the difference of what was done and what wasn't.) I confronted him about it (Calmly mind you.) and he goes off and gives me his attitude as per the norm. Things obviously verbally escalate, and he tells me to leave (Even though I was calm the entire time.) And I know if I left, nothing would be done about it.\\n\\nFlash forward to today, and he made himself some lunch (School's out for today.) He always has a problem with making sure he gets his dirty dishes inside the dishwasher, and he usually leaves his messes for someone else to clean up. Today is my mother's birthday, and in knowing this; I knew she would be absolutely livid if she saw the mess he made. I went to his room (Again, calmly) To tell him to clean up his mess, and to do so very quickly. If either of my parents would see the mess he made of the kitchen, they would be pissed. And I didn't want them to get mad on my mother's birthday, and I didn't want to clean his mess up for him because he needs to learn to do it on his own.\\n\\nI go out to get a snack as he's cleaning, and I told him how we get along for a week or so and he becomes an insufferable douche. Then he tells me that he can't wait until I move out, even though it probably won't happen and he called me a fat ass with a superiority complex. All because I told him to clean up his mess, and mow his part of the lawn (Which hasn't even been done yet.)\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: Thank you so far for the feedback! I'll definitely try and tone down how much I tell him what to do.\\nI would like to mention/ask a few things however. I'm not looking to change minds, I genuinely want help.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter whether or not you ask him kindly to do something or tell him. A majority of the time he will get huffy about it. Even with my parents.\\n\\nThe only one he doesn't seem to have a problem listening to is our oldest brother (21). And they never fight whenever he tells him to do something, and he even agrees that I'm usually right on most matters.\\n\\nIs there any way for me to ensure that he'll start cleaning up after himself without sounding bossy? Or for my parents to do so? I don't want them to have to clean up after him, nor do I think I should have to either.\\n\\nOnce again, thank you for the responses! I'll keep them in mind next time a think a confrontation might happen. I'll definitely try to ask him instead of tell him more often, and I won't pester him about his chores as much.

few months. I have a place to stay and all that. I've tried to discuss this with my parents so I'm not just walking out the door one day, but they refuse to listen. They like to pretend it's not happening. I'm the oldest sibling, so I understand that cutting the cord must be hard. But it's bound to happen eventually.\\n\\nI had posted on Facebook that I was at a bar near where I'd be moving to. A friend of mine commented saying I was minutes away from her house. I responded saying I'll be moving down there in a few months and we can hangout and whatnot. This was posted last night.\\n\\nThis morning I wake up to a text from my mom saying that before I go posting things like that on Facebook I should talk to her and dad first. I responded saying that I've tried and they won't listen. I know when I get home later today they'll want to have a discussion about how I need to watch what I post online and blah blah blah (I'm 21 for god's sake. I make an innocent joke about Ted Cruz awhile ago and my mom gave me a long chat about that).\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like at my age, and the fact that I pay all of my own bills already (insurance, car, phone. Everything except medical.) should be grounds that I can move out basically whenever I want. Am I wrong?   \n",

My boyfriend hates unnatural hair colors and while he says he'll love me regardless he thinks it looks trashy and he is gonna be bummed out if I dye it. I think I'm gonna do it anyway. Am I an asshole?**\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half now. He's loving, caring blah blah blah. We have a great relationship with some minor conflict, but everything has been getting better (he grew up in a shitty household and this is his first real long term relationship, so he's kinda learning how a healthy relationship works). He's 25 and I'm 21.\\n\\nWhen I go through periods of stress I usually get myself a big \"gift\", usually something that is a big change. I'm in college so generally this is once a semester. Last semester I got a cat, the semester before that I got a pet snake, the one before that I went platinum blonde and the one before that I dyed my hair red. For some reason it helps me cope with stress. \\n\\nSo it's getting to that time again and I figured my \"gift\" this semester would be dying my hair some crazy colors. I've always wanted to do that and I feel like if I do it I need to do it soon since I probably won't be able to after graduation because I'll have a job (or at least be seeking one). I've been floating the idea past my boyfriend for a few months but yesterday I asked him in earnest to tell me what he thought. I sent a few pictures of styles I liked for his opinion and he confessed that he hated unnatural hair dyes, thought they looked trashy and that he really couldn't see himself liking any hair dye on me because he likes my natural color. \\n\\nI even tried photoshopping some different hair colors on a picture of me to see if that would change his mind (and because it was fun) but he still hated it. He told me I could do what I want, that he would still love me but that he prefers my natural hair and mentioned that if I had an appearance preference for him, he would do it. He told me he would still support me regardless and that it's my body to do what I want with, he was just gonna hate the way it looked.\\n\\nInitially I figured I would just not dye it and that would be that, but I'm having a really hard time giving up on the idea and I feel like I'll regret it later if I don't go a little crazy now while I have the chance. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just do it anyway but I feel shitty. I know if he wanted to do something like buzz his hair that I wouldn't like I'd be kinda disappointed too, I don't blame him at all for that. But does doing it anyway make me an asshole?   \n",

situation.\\n\\n\\n\\nYesterday at work, me and my small group of work friends were having lunch. My (F26 white non-religious) good friend (F26 white non-religious) started going off about how much she hates Christmas, because it's racist and exclusive and unfair, et cetera. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I do not think Christmas is racist. I will admit that it's unfair that most Christian holidays are Canada's federal holidays, but whatareyougonnado. Really I think no religious holidays should be federal holidays, and we should just get extra Vacation time in lieu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso worth noting that I am really trying to get into the Christmas \"spirit\" because of how dark and dreary the days are getting. I mainly see Christmas as a celebration with lights and decorations and being with those you love. My bf and I have planned a week long holiday to New York for Christmas and I'm very excited. She knows all this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis isn't the first time in the last couple weeks that she's ranted a little about Christmas' racism and exclusion. Over the weekend, I had sent her a bunch of pictures of my cat in a cute reindeer sweater. She had responded positively with \"CHRISTMAS BABY!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo when she was ranting I smiled and was like \"haha, you can't hate Christmas thaaaaat much when my kitties are so cute in their Christmas sweaters!\" she kind of laughed and was like \"yeah, no I hate Christmas.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOk, fine, whatever. I didn't think anything of it. It didn't feel like a negative interaction to me. But I guess I really struck a nerve, because about an hour later she sent me an instant message basically saying \"I can hate Christmas and all the racist things about it and still like pictures of cats,\" but longer. I couldn't think of anything to say so I just didn't reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike, ok? Yes? Of course you can? I was just teasing... It wasn't like I was roasting her loudly in front of all our friends, it was just a quiet smiling prod, like we do sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, she hasn't talked to me since. I'm hesitant to say anything as I feel alienated. AITA?\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

I was raised in the Mormon church, but mentally left at 14.  I told my parents how I felt at 16 and it did not go well; they said I was deceived by Satan and corrupting my younger siblings etc.  It is only recently that they have allowed me to not come with them to Church on Sundays, which was a major source of anxiety for me.\\n\\nHowever, my parents want me to come with them on Christmas Day.  I don't know anyone in this new ward and I don't want to give them the idea that I'm interested in coming back or whatever.  Also, I struggle with anxiety and don't think I could handle being going, even just for Christmas.  I have tried explaining this to them and they either don't take me seriously or mock me for it.  Am I the asshole?   \n",

I hoped someone would be big enough to offer me or John one, but no.\\n\\nSo me and John now share one tiny bedroom which we ended up putting two mattresses on the floor and sleeping on that.\\n\\nSo, sorry it's so long but... Am I the asshole for thinking myself or John should have gotten a double bedroom, or are they for being selfish?\\n\\n**tldr: housemates took the only two double bedrooms in the house even though they're single leaving me and my boyfriend to have two tiny single bedrooms.**\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nedit: Just to clarify, when I say double bedorom I mean a bedroom with a double bed in it.

       "      <td>Hi /r/AmITheAsshole! I just heard this community exists and I thought it would be the perfect place to talk about this. I posted the whole story in /r/pettyrevenge and got a really mixed bag of responses, so I'm curious what people here think.\\n\\nBasically, I was at a John Mayer concert, in a pretty good seat but off to the side (not in the pit, which is relevant). When JM came out, he was playing a really rockin' tune, so I stood up and started jamming out. I would say ~90% of the people in the arena were standing for this, but my section was a disproportionately sitting one. I was really the only one in the immediate area standing. I would stand and sit intermittently as the songs went on based on the dance-factor of the song and how much I liked it.\\n\\nAt one point while I was standing up, two women about four rows behind me started throwing popcorn at me and yelling at me to sit down. I got really embarrassed and sat, but after a few minutes I was upset with how they had handled it, so a few songs later, I stood back up (with the help of my girlfriend and a few other people around us who had scene the exchange). By this point a few other isolated people/couples had done the same for a couple songs at a time. My \"petty revenge\" was subtly encouraging people around me to stand up, helping create a majority so that a.) it would be fine for me to stand and b.) the women would have a harder time telling 20 people to sit down.\\n\\nTo be fair, I was a lot meaner in the telling in /r/pettyrevenge, so [here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y9dny/standing_up_for_my_right_to_stand_up/) if you'd like to read it and the ensuing comments. I just kind of assumed people would be on my side, as you can tell by my whiny edit at the top. \\n\\nAm I the asshole? I want to believe I'm not, mostly because I think throwing popcorn at someone is incredibly rude, at which point I didn't care, and I would have responded much more sympathetically to a more gentle approach. Other people felt that I was not entitled to any courtesies because I started the asshole train by standing in the first place, and honestly I understand that too, which is why I sat down in the first place. I didn't want to be rude and block views. But I also believed that I wasn't in the wrong to stand given the nature of the act--he's got some jams and is very encouraging of light dancing. Still, for people that just wanted to sit down and enjoy the show, I was definitely hurting the experience. Please let me know what you think.\\n\\n**tl;dr** Stood up at a concert, got popcorn'd, stood back up later, encouraging others to do the same.</td>\n",

We'd been at a bar and I have an 8am shift in the morning so I had to go to bed. My boyfriend however wanted to go pick up some booze and go to his mates for some more drinks - absolutely fine by me. \\n\\nSo I call a taxi to take me home and he asks me if I want him to stay with me. I say no its absolutely fine go get booze with your mates. He offered a  couple of times and I said I'm absolutely fine just go. So he did. \\n\\nThen as I was stood alone in the street waiting for my taxi I realised I actually thought it was really shitty of him to leave me like that. And I know, I fucking SAID it was fine. I did. And that's why I think I'm the asshole. But.... A part of me just got annoyed he would actually leave me like that alone at night on the street. \\n\\nSo yeah I know I said it was fine, and this is the thing - I meant it at the time. I really did. I'm not one of those girls who plays mind games with guys (or at least I didn't think I was) and so when I said it it wasn't meant as some sort of fucking test.. I did mean it.

My brother's fiance's mom was told to come and feed the kittens at 10 before she was going to work.I'd feed them the other times during the day as they need to be fed every three hours.  Keep in mind, these aren't my kittens the mother was not my cat. I plan on keeping one of the kittens other then that it shouldn't be my problem. I've been feeding and bathing them while they are at work.\\n\\nMonday me and my gf walk in on this http://imgur.com/a/VASih and spent 3 hours between going to walmart and buying them two smaller litter boxes so they'd be easier to clean. Cleaning supplies to sanitize the area. Cat food for them because they have diarrhea and I thought reverting back to the old brand would be better for them. Bathed them cleaned everything. It took 3 hours to do, three hours in the middle of the day when I wanted to do other things. I've also bought a majority of their food. Watched them over a long weekend while they were at the coast. Took them to the vet for them. \\n\\nMy gf went to work, my brother came home. Told him that me and my gf were pissed, her especially about how bad things were. He asked if he should apologize. I said yeah. Then he started getting pissed and defensive saying he shouldn't appologize to my girlfriend for the way HE raises HIS cats. I say, well you should appologize to her because we spent three hours today cleaning up shit, litterally, that wasn't our fucking mess. He said \"well you chose to do that, you didn't have to.\" I told him, no conscionable human being would leave animals in that condition a second longer. He said \"look, they have diarhea and they shit and they leave paw prints of shit places. We clean it daily.\" Told him \"If I walked in on that at someone else's house, I'd of called the cops.\" He said he's not going to appologize. \\n\\nYesterday his fiance was slamming doors that morning at 7am. I left to do stuff came back at 7pm. Went straight to the kitties room. It was clean but they forgot to fill up their water bowl. Went to my room didn't talk to them.\\n\\nWednesday, (today) his fiance comes in. My gf is here today, wasn't yesterday. Says we have no right to call her neglectful that they clean their room daily. That she woke up and there was a couple shits in the shower but that she had to work and she'd figure we'd clean it when we woke up and that she is not going to appologize. The future sister in law was raising her voice and didn't let my gf speak more then a couple words and had a look of crazy on her face. Are me and the gf really over reacting to the situation or is it as fucked up as I think it is. \\n\\nI also want to point out that other then this instance the kittens have been well taken care of. They told me that they cleaned their room the day before, I don't believe them. I bathe them regularly, they don't give a shit, and I feed and water them regularly. \\n\\n**tldr: do you consider this abuse? http://imgur.com/a/VASih or am I an asshole for calling my brother and his fiance neglectful and expecting an apology?**</td>\n",

She asked me to not talk to my mother about my problems because she was afraid of it happening again. A few days ago I got into a fight with my girlfriend because I looked at her text messages without her permission (she allows me to do so if I ask her to). Naturally, she was very offended by what I did and an argument followed. This has been one of the worst arguments we have ever had, with her giving me an ultimatum to either clean up my act or have her leave. I, confused and upset with myself about this whole mess, decided to talk with my mother about my problem. In my girlfriend's and her friends' eyes, I am a jerk who manipulates her and causes problems. To my mother, my girlfriend is the one who causes the problems and manipulates me. Today, I resolved my issue with my girlfriend by promising her to not be as paranoid as I have been before. Only now, she refuses to come over because she feels like my mother hates her, and she claims that I have started another major problem in our relationship, although my mother only claimed that she disliked the way my girlfriend treated me during our argument. Am I the asshole for talking to my mother about my problems?\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for the feedback everyone. I have left out some information when I posted this, so please bear with me. I had the fight with my girlfriend the night before I went on a 3 day road trip with my family. When I was texting my girlfriend during my trip, she was treating me very coldly and bitterly, which is understandable. Although she was very upset with me and gave me a one month warning to clean up my act, she acted as if she doubted my ability to make things better with her. This made me very upset throughout my whole vacation, which is the reason my mother is upset with her. In addition, during my vacation (where I had little to no reception, so talking to her was almost out of the question) she decides to inform me that she was going to hang out with my best friend, a male, for one day that I was gone. She told me not to worry about it. To show her that I'm making a major attempt to not be jealous and possessive (as the best friend she was to hang out with had rudely pointed out to me a day prior), I told her I was not worried about it. After my vacation I tried to ask her if she was glad that I was making improvement. Instead, she once again treated me coldly, claiming that I shouldn't have been worried in the first place. This also upsetted my mother as my girlfriend had left out the fact that she needed help getting around (as she was home alone for the day), which in turn made her claim to hang out with my best friend seem as if she was trying to spite me for being jealous/possesive.</td>\n",

It was a three hour drive to the campsite, so we stopped along the way to have dinner at my in laws, who live nearby. My friend and her son didn't like the dinner (spaghetti), so I ran to the store to get him mac and cheese. At that time, I asked if she wanted to go with me, since she had told me she needed groceries. She hemmed and hawed and finally said no, we can go later. So, we eat dinner, and then decide to leave asap, since it will be getting dark in a few hours and we wanted to get set up in daylight. At this point I made my fatal error. I forgot to go to the grocery store. Along the way, my friend mentions this...but at this point we are no longer near a grocery store, so I stop at Sheetz, which is a large gas/convenience store. She gets her stuff, we go to the campsite and set up. For the entire weekend she proceeds to complain about not having food, even though my husband stopped at the store and got her food that she requested, as well as the fact that the campout we went to had plenty of food, there was a potluck breakfast, and I went searching for food that she wanted and found it. Still not enough. Might I mention that her son didn't give a crap about the food,  he was only stressed because she was making him stressed, imo.. we didn't speak for a week afterwards, and when we did hang out, she proceeds to tell me how I fucked up her weekend.  I cry, then leave.\\n\\nTl;dr I forgot to take my friend to the store, she proceeds to ruin my trip, says its all my fault.\\n\\nEdit: I had packed lots of food, which she also refused to eat...but she drank our beer and left half bottles of it everywhere.

       "      <td>I posted this in TwoXChromosomes but I think maybe this is a good place for advice too...\\n\\nMy boyfriend (we will call him Rex) and I had been dating almost 2 years. The first year, I was a senior in college and he had graduated a year earlier and co-founded a startup. Of the guys I'd dated, he was the most put-together, the most reliable, the most attractive, the LEAST argumentative (we never ever fought), and I felt had the most potential. At the end of the day though, I felt as if he didn't \"get me\" like my other partners had, but as it was his first real relationship I decided not to give up on this great guy.\\n\\nUpon graduation, I was offered a job 900 miles away. Rex had his company back home and couldn't leave. I wanted to break it off right then and save myself the pain, but he and his sweet words convinced me we could make it work. Neither of us believes in soulmates so we thought if we put in the work we could make it happen. I moved, he stayed, and our long-distance relationship began.\\n\\nAnd by LDR, I mean my chronic loneliness. I am not an outgoing person, I didn't know a single person in the whole state, I walked into my empty apartment crying almost every day, and I clung to Rex for comfort. We alternate turns to take a flight and got to see each other maybe every other month. He truly tried to be there for me, but those happy weekends when he came down would only make me sadder when he left again. He said what he could but I knew my depression was wearing on him and us. At one point he told me just to stop talking about sad things. I knew I had to turn things around, and luckily I was at a company full of young transplants like me, so I began forcing myself to go out on weekends. I flourished. I made friends, got to know the new city, and was finally smiling again. The problem with this new life was that Rex wasn't a part of it. He didn't know the people I talked about and couldn't relate to the culture I was now a part of. I live in an awesome place, and when I would tell him about the fun times I was having I felt like I was rubbing it in his face. I felt completely torn; like I had to choose between a life of sadness with Rex and a life of happiness without him.\\n\\nFF to this JanuaryโI was laid off from my amazing job. I got a freelance gig to pay rent while I found a new job while all those friends I made moved away. By this time things were worse with Rex. Not that we were dysfunctional, but instead of growing closer as two people are supposed to do over time, we grew further and further apart. I felt single 99% of the time. When he would visit, I would get annoyed at another person being in my space and it took me a while to warm up to him physically again. I couldn't see marriage in our future (truth is I think I'm too young to see marriage at all), and I wanted to break it off what was left of our relationship because we were both pouring so much emotion, effort, and money into this thing. I wanted to do it in person of course and the next opportunity was February. My parents were supposed to be visiting before he got here, but their flights got messed up and my mother, father, and Rex all ended up staying with me that weekend. How could I break up with him in that situation? I decided to wait until the next opportunity.\\n\\nBefore that opportunity came, Rex's cofounders kicked him out of his own company. It was a terrible situation, his world was crashing down, and I still considered him my best friend so I just didn't have the heart to break up with him in a time like that. We always said when we were free, we'd be together again. I wanted to stay here and he didn't want to go home or stay in a college town so naturally he wanted to move here for me. Even though he was hurting from his situation I knew I could not let him do that. How could I let him move his whole life for someone who wasn't nearly on the same page relationship-wise? I also knew that since I had lost all my friends, we would cling to each other and not go out and meet new people. I flew back home, and I ended it. I felt awful, and of course he accused me of only dating him \"for his company.\"\\nNot even two weeks later, Rex's best childhood friend committed suicide. I found out on social media and broke down crying at work. I immediately called him and left a message just to know if he needed to talk he could. This great guy had just been betrayed by his company, his girlfriend, and his friend. We went through a couple weeks of txting/calling, that would go from friendly to \"fuck you\" in a second. He left it at \"I'll reach out when I'm ready to talk to you again\" and I left him alone.\\n\\nI had told Rex that I wanted to be single for a while because I hadn't been single longer than 3 months since I was 16. But life is funny sometimes, and I unexpectedly found a new guy who I just CLICKED with immediately. He thought I was funny, he loved to dance, we could talk forever, and it made me wonder why I'd spent so many silent, danceless nights with Rex. Like I said, I had felt single and alone for so long. But it was only about a month after the breakup so initially I tried to hide it from social media to not hurt my ex. However, he started posting pictures of his new girl and I assumed all was well again.\\n\\nOne of the last things Rex said to me was to let him know if my address ever changed. I'm going through a move to a new apartment now and texted him to let him know. He texts me back to let me know he's in bed with his new girl talking to her about how terrible I am and how neither of them can fathom \"what kind of person\" would have done what I did. He said I was mean during his hard times, even though I tried to be there for him as much as I knew how. He couldn't believe I was dating someone, even though he was doing the exact same thing. The text ended with \"I could give a shit about anyone like you anymore.\"\\n\\nI know I should just move on and not care, but I am so hurt. I'm the type of person that can't deal with anyone being upset with me, it just kills me to the core. Just because I didn't want to be with him romantically anymore doesn't mean I stopped caring about him as a person. The timing in this whole thing was the worst it could have possibly been.\\n\\nWas I in the wrong? Should I have let him move his life to a new city to support him in his time of need, knowing that I didn't want to be with him? What could I have done differently? Does he truly hate me, or was that just an emotional response? AM I an asshole?\\n\\nI know this was long, but thanks for caring &amp;lt;3</td>\n",

The details in the post should be enough to identify me if they stumble upon this post, but my sister has, in the past, looked up my post history and used it against me.  Anyway,\\n\\n**Back story**\\n\\nIn 2009, my fiancee and I were renting an apartment when my grandmother went into a rehabilitation facility after a fall.  My family was pretty sure she wouldn't be coming back home, and they asked my fiancee and I to move in.  They told us at this time that we would be renting from them under the terms that:\\n\\n- They would charge us a rental fee equal to the mortgage amount, no more and no less (so we were basically paying the mortgage but the house wasn't in our name and we can't claim it on our taxes)\\n\\n- When we were ready to buy, they would sell the house to us at [Market Value - 10% - {however much money we had paid in rent so far}]\\n\\n- If something ever happened to them, they would leave the house to us in their will.\\n\\nIn 2011, we got married (yay!) and we were going to start saving up to buy the house.  They told us at this point that they realized they couldn't fulfill the terms of the \"MV-10%-paid\" plan they previously suggested, that they would lose too much money.  We would just have to pay market value. ($130k)  We asked the price, they told us, and we balked.  We said it was out of our price range ($80-100k) and we would be looking around.\\n\\nWe contacted a realtor, got preapproved, we were going through a first time homebuyer class that, if completed, would pay our down payment and closing costs (up to $5000) on the house.\\n\\nOnce my mom found out, she got really worried.  She said she wanted us to stay in this house.\\n\\nA point relevant to the story that is important and complicates matters that I had neglected to mention to this point is that our house is next door to their house.  We share a yard (and we're not really outdoor people so their use of our yard is like 95% to 5% compared to our own), they have two sheds in our yard for storage, my father keeps a bunch of stuff in our basement and my mother keeps a bunch of stuff in our attic, so clearly they have an interest in not wanting us to move beyond just \"I want my kid next door to me\"  Anyway, moving on...\\n\\nWe reminded them that we could not afford the house at the price they were asking and were going to have to look elsewhere.  Eventually, my mom told us to stop looking for houses; that they would do \"whatever it takes to get you this house.\"\\n\\nThe deal they were offering was: They would sell the house to us at $130,000, with a $30,000 gift of equity.  That GoE would be our down payment on the house, which would allow us to avoid PMI and would put our loan amount at $100,000 (which was within our price range).  We accepted.\\n\\nGoing through the homebuying process, our lender had a house appraiser come out and appraise it.  The house appraised for 120k (10k less than what their appraiser said).  They weren't happy but still agreed to go through with the deal rather than have us look elsewhere.\\n\\nIn April of 2014, we became homeowners.  Everything was going fine, until...\\n\\n**Recent events**\\n\\nEarly last month I came out to my mom as transgender.  I've felt this way for a while but had been scared to tell her.  I was afraid they might kick us out of the house if they knew, which was why we wanted to move first.  We accepted the deal on this house because it was a good deal; we wouldn't have accepted it otherwise.\\n\\nMy mom has been taking it rough.  When I first told her, she seemed fine, but she later said that she was in shock.  Eventually she asked me if I knew [that I was transgender] before they sold us the house.  I said yes.  She accused me of deceiving them and screwing them and ripping them off.  I asked, \"If I had told you when we were renting, would you have kicked us out?\"  She said yes.\\n\\nShe later rescinded that \"yes\", said she didn't mean it; she was angry.  She apologized, but still insisted upon how we tricked/screwed/deceived her.  I asked \"Would you have sold me the house if I had told you before you did?\"  She said no.\\n\\nTo this point, we hadn't told my dad, yet.  Whenever I brought it up, she shot it down, saying he should \"go to his grave without ever finding out about this\" and other such things.  Meanwhile, she was smoking heavily, drinking heavily, and she repeatedly dropped hints that she might be doing pot or acid but I don't know if they were true or bluffing.\\n\\n**Last week and Sunday**\\n\\nLast week, she said she wanted everyone to sit down together and we were going to tell my dad.  That was scheduled for the Sunday that just passed (7/20).  At the table were my mom and dad, my dad's pastor, my sister and her husband, me and my wife, my mother in law and her son (my wife's brother).\\n\\nI told him, to which he admitted that he knew, he had known for a month (My mom told him) and the pastor had been counseling him for the past month.\\n\\nHe immediately dove in to the matter of the house, that they felt deceived, and that I needed to \"make it right\".  I told him \"When we're ready to move, I will sell you the house back.\"  \"At the same deal we gave you?\" \"Yes\"\\n\\nHe says \"Good.  That makes me feel better.  That's water under the bridge.\" and we begin talking about me for a bit...\\n\\nEventually though, it comes back to the house.  He insists that we must sell it back to them before 12/1 of this year, otherwise they will have to pay capitol gains tax on the money they made on the house if they do not reinvest it, and they will need that money to afford to buy the house back.  He says we can go back to renting from them, under the condition that \"you don't escalate the situation or try to throw it in our face.\"\\n\\nWhen pressed for details, he was basically saying that he doesn't want to see me \"dressed like that\" or \"acting like that.\"  I pointed out that I've been going out in public like this for the past three years and they haven't noticed.  The pastor chimes in by asking my father \"What if you do run into him by accident, then what?\" (still using a male pronoun for me)  My father says \"I can let it go, ONCE.\"  I ask \"So what happens after once, then what?\"  And he just sort of deflects.  I asked for examples of \"rubbing it in his face\" that I wouldn't be allowed to do, he doesn't want to see \"any rainbow stickers on your car\" and was a huge stickler about when I said \"sometimes I take the trash out at night in a skirt, but you're usually in bed that late\" to which he keeps pushing that I need to get changed if I do this, just in case he comes outside and sees me.\\n\\nI tell them I can't agree to these terms, and there's a dispute where they insult me for 'changing my mind' (paraphrase) when I make it clear that I said I'd sell it back *when we were ready to move* and that I could not possibly come up with enough money to buy a house by December (even, and I'm being extremely generous, if I could come up with $500 a month in savings, every month, for five months, that's still barely half of a down payment) short of winning the lottery.  I tell them we could be ready to move in 2-3 years, this is unacceptable to them, they're pushing that December 1st deadline on me, HARD.\\n\\n**Events over this week**\\n\\nMy mother called me on Monday to try to persuade me to change my mind and I declined.  She called my wife and talked to her as well but didn't get anywhere.\\n\\nShe called me again on Tuesday to try to persuade me again with no luck.  She says to me \"Your wife came to me in tears and sat there on my couch and PROMISED me you would make it right.  Are you going to honor your wife's promise or not?\"  I tell her I will need to talk to my wife.\\n\\nMy wife vehemently denies it.  The following transpired in a separate room on Sunday, while I was still chatting one on one with the Pastor after everyone else had left the room. \"I was on the couch, *she* came to *me* and asked me to sell them the house back.  I said we would, but I didn't say when or how and I was NOT crying.\"\\n\\nYou'd think this was one of those hearsay moments but as fortune would have it, she and I were having some friends over after the family talk, and one of them showed up early and came next door (my mother let them in), so they were sitting right there on the couch next to my wife.  I called them and they confirmed my wife's account of the events, insisting that my mom was full of shit.\\n\\nAt this point, my wife doesn't want to talk to or see my mom, and my mother in law gets wind of it and is pretty livid, too.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, my mom calls my wife as soon as I leave for work.  My wife didn't answer, so my mom comes next door, lets herself in, and begins a conversation (less a conversation and more a \"I'm going to talk and you're going to listen\") with my wife.\\n\\nNow, my wife is the sweetest person ever.  If you were so inclined, she'd let you walk all over her and apologize for being so lumpy.  She tells me, \"It's a good thing I was at the top of the stairs and she was at the bottom, cause otherwise I would have slapped her\".  In the seven years I've known this woman, only one other time have I ever seen her this angry.\\n\\nMy mother in law told me that my mom apparently left her a message.  She played it back to me; it was a combination of snippets of truth, peppered with distortions of things I had said reworded into things I hadn't, and ended with \"I'm sorry my son is ruining your daughter's life.\"\\n\\n**The current situation**\\n\\nMy parents don't even want to talk about \"the transgender thing\" until I \"make it right\".  If I don't sell them the house before 12/1, they probably won't be a part of my life anymore, and if they will, it'll be a wreck, considering I still have to live next door to them.  My sister has been remaining mostly neutral but she's siding with them in that if I don't give them what they want, she won't want me around either.  (Alt...</td>\n",

He currently lives with his parents in a city about 3 hours away from our university, and I live with mine on the opposite side of the country. He has been in a bad financial situation after wrecking his car, and his construction work hasn't been giving him many hours. \\n\\nWhenever I talk to him he is always talking about his \"lazy days\" where he gets stoned and drunk and plays halo all day. \\n\\nSince I moved back to my city I've been working a full time and a part time job, and haven't gotten time off to visit him like I did last summer. In order to lock down a place for us to live in September I had asked him to check out places. I had looked online and emailed landlords, but he didn't have a car to go down to check them out. He got a ride once with his dad who goes down 2-3 times a week and looked at one place. I'm supposed to move out there in 2 weeks\\n\\n**The incident in question:**\\nA couple days ago I was talking to him on one of his \"lazy days.\" I was already pissy before I talked to him cause of work bullshit, but I asked him why he wasn't looking for places to live when his dad was down in our uni town. He said he \"wants a lazy day before he goes on his trip\" I asked him what trip he was talking about and he said he had decided to go on a two week long fishing trip with his buddy on his commercial tuna fishing boat. \\nI flipped out and told him I was really worried about finding a place to live and now he's gone for two weeks and I'm supposed to move out there in two weeks. He said his dad could look at houses and he needed this trip to make money. I was yelling at him and telling him he was immature and that me and his dad was doing more to help us find a place then he did. He said he really needs the money and he's gonna make a lot as a deck hand. \\nI said he was \"an asshole and being really immature and had been lazy and irresponsible all summer and that I would just find a place by myself and he could find his own place or sleep on the street cause he's too much of a baby to figure his shit out\"  he told me it works both ways and if I had come to visit him we could have found a place earlier. More swearing and name calling back on forth until he hung up on me. Now he's gone for ~2 weeks. \\n\\nI know he needs the money, so am I the asshole?\\n\\nTL;DR: broke boyfriend needs fish, pissed girlfriend needs a home</td>\n",

My boyfriend ended up getting too drunk to go out, they still want to go and ask if they can stay in our room because they can't afford their own. This really pisses me off because there's eight of them, it's not that expensive to split $140 and there was not enough room in ours (12 people total). They invited more people without telling us (one who my boyfriend really doesn't get along with) and said they would give us some money if they could all sleep on the floor. \\n\\nWe ended up kicking them out. They were all really pissed and said they would get a room somewhere else. They drank all our alcohol and I think they even took  a bottle of my wine with them. They took the alcohol they brought as well, which is fine I'm just mad they drank all of ours because I wanted some of it for today. I feel bad but I wasn't trying to have a huge party in the room and I didn't want to deal with them all being drunk when they got back when we were just trying to have a calm night.

I've heard you say racist shit!\\n\\nTina: No I just talk about stuff that's happened to me. They're racist against me. They're all fucking like that.

That's racist! \\n\\nTina: There's no way that's racist, I can totally understand why she'd feel that way!\\n\\nEventually during this conversation, Tina admits that she really hates black people.\\n\\n[Insert me trying to explain what racism is and that even if you feel justified for hating a group of people, you're still racist]\\n\\nTina: Okay you know what you have no idea what I've been through and how hard my job has been because of all the awful shit black people say to me at my job, and you obviously DON'T CARE.\\n\\n[Tina proceeds to storm off]\\n\\n\\nSo basically the argument ended after that, there's a lot of other shit that happened but those are the barebone details.

After dozens of therapy sessions, emergency hospital visits, and thousands of dollars worth of medical debt, my only form of control over my anxiety has been taking xanax for the past 6+ years. \\n\\nI've been with my girlfriend for over 3 years and my anxiety disorder has yet to be fully understood by her. We've had arguments before about it and she's said things like, \"Everyone stresses out all the time, you're not alone in this\" and \"All you need to do is thing positive thoughts and relax\" or \"Being addicted to drugs isn't the answer\". She can't seem to grasp the uncontrollable, life grasping, dark and depressing nature of anxiety and how it is a mental disorder and not just a mood swing. I think it's because she and her family have never dealt with mental disorder before and, like many of us redditors deal with, have no idea what the solution or results are.\\n\\nSo I went to her dentist's office today because I wanted to try a new dentist. When I went today, I asked her dentist if she could schedule the first cleaning for another time because I have anxiety and I need to take medicine to be able to be calm through even the most basic medical procedures. In fact, I start to hyperventilate, get short breath, and panic when I go to job interviews if I don't take xanax beforehand. So her dentist totally understood and told me she's there to make things as comfortable as I need. I was on the phone with my girlfriend just talking about my day and I told her this bit and she says, \"Why didn't you let her just do the cleaning? She would have let you relax or calm down if you needed to\" but it's not as simple as that. If I begin to get an anxiety attack, it will take a lot of downtime for me to get past it and the experience of it is too horrible for me to willingly go through. I tried to tell my girlfriend this and she says, \"Okay fine, whatever, I just think you don't need to pop pills all the time and should have just let her do her job.\" ... So I stayed silent for a bit and then just hung up on her. Now I'm pissed off at her and just wanna cuss her out.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? I have a god damn mental disorder that's plagued me for the past 10+ years and it will most likely stay with me for the rest of my life. I would have probably killed myself long ago if I didn't have xanax to keep my brain from going crazy and my body from self destructing. But it's all trivialized by my girlfriend, as if it's just something to shrug off my shoulder and easily fixed with a bright smile or something. \\n\\n**TL;DR: I need to take medicine before I even have a cleaning at the dentists office because of my anxiety but my girlfriend doesn't think my anxiety is a real problem and that I need to get over it.**</td>\n",

He was around, but was busy with his marriage and finishing up his degree (we were both in the same year of undergrad in different majors).\\n\\nSo we drifted apart. And then about 2.5 years ago, we basically stopped talking completely. He had moved off campus and was commuting to classes. It's cool. It happens. And neither one of us really made an effort to hang out with the other or make contact at all.\\n\\nFast forward to 2013- I proposed to my girlfriend and we started the engagement process. We started making invite lists and had to trim them down drastically. We got to my friend and decided that it would be alright if we didn't invite him and his wife. He had a bit of an argumentative attitude and we knew that he probably wouldn't get along with one of her family members. Plus, we figured it would be one of those situations where they knew we were getting married (yay for Facebook) and would be happy for us, but would understand not being invited since we had drifted so far apart.\\n\\nLast week, I received a series of texts from the first friend saying that they are severely hurt and upset that they included me in their wedding and now they don't even get invited to ours. \\n\\nI told him that I could see where he was coming from, and that we would love it if they could make it.\\n\\nHe gave me an address to send an invitation but told me that he probably couldn't get the time off work. \\n\\nMy thought was, \"Sooooo...you want me to send you an invitation to a wedding you weren't invited to...so that you can say that you can't make it?\"\\n\\nAm I in the wrong here?

I am just kind of posting here for my own sanity, and maybe to reflect in a \"change my view\" sort of way.\\n\\nMy girlfriend is a big fan of The 1975, a band that is gaining a lot of popularity right now. She has gotten me into this band also, and even though I had heard a few of their songs before, it's really to her credit that I listen to their music right now. But anyway, she has been into the band for probably over a year now. Recently, popular acts like One Direction, Taylor Swift, and 5 Seconds of Summer have cited the band as a favorite of theirs, giving them an influx of new fans who have not liked the band for as long. On top of this, the band is very popular with the \"hipster\" crowd online (especially on tumblr) and she seems to fit into that crowd on this issue. She often complains about the new fans, claiming that she is a bigger fan because she has followed the music for longer. She tends to get a very (excuse me for the bias here) elitist attitude, going as far as to say that the people who haven't liked the band for as long as she and some of the other fans have are only pretending to like them because it's somewhat the cool thing to do right now. She was very vocal in her complaints about the \"fourteen year olds\" who apparently are not mature enough to like this music and are only doing so because they saw One Direction tweet about them or something. She also claims that the concerts are \"kind of ruined now\" because all of these younger fans act viciously and violently to get near the stage and scream at the boys on stage, although I didn't see much of anything even close to this when we saw them in concert. She maintains that I couldn't possibly understand how violent fourteen year old girls are at concerts because I am a boy. In addition, I have pointed out that these fans are in exactly the same spot years ago when she was close to that age with acts like Justin Bieber and One Direction. I really don't mind her opinion, and it's not like an issue that we fight about or anything, but if it comes up I just kind of shake it off and nod my head while she rants about something I completely disagree with. I do not judge her for this nor do I think it's my place to try to \"correct\" her, but I just kind of needed to get this off of my chest and also confirm that it isn't ridiculous for me to be annoyed when she brings something like this up. Clearly it does bother me a little that we have such opposing viewpoints, enough even to post about it on reddit, but I really just need a second opinion, I don't plan on showing this to her or anything it's really just for my own comfort. Am I crazy to be annoyed at this \"I liked them before they were cool\" elitist attitude, or is it fair for her to be angry at young fans who, in her opinion, are not true fans and just following the crowd?</td>\n",

We purchased it for 100,000 with a 5,000 down-payment that I paid out of my personal IRA (a special rule allows for first time homeowners to use IRA money penalty free up to 10,000). \\n\\nAt this time her job started to take off (she is a recruiter for accounting and finance jobs), to the level that it put her on track to make $150,000 in 2014.  I make approximately 47,000 at my job, and it is salaried, no commission will increase it like hers.\\n\\nAnyway, she decided in February that she no longer wanted to be together which started a long period of me begging her not to leave, and her saying she had made up her mind and there was nothing that was going to change that.  \\n\\nI felt it was fishy at the time, I had not treated her poorly or done anything I felt was worthy of being divorced over, but she assured me she just wasn't happy with where her life was going and wanted to try something different.  \\n\\nIn May of 2014 she moved into an apartment in Chicago with a few girls, and as of next week we will be officially divorced.  I tried to reconcile multiple times over the last 10 months, but to no avail.\\n\\nAll of this is important because when she split she said I could have the house, as it is not paid off, I will have the benefit of keeping the house, but will incur the mortgage myself.  By the time she left we had paid off $23,000 in total, including the $5,000 down payment.   Two days ago she e-mailed me and stated that I needed to refinance and take out an additional $10,000 that is owed to her for half of what was paid on the house.\\n\\nI do not think I owe her anything, she was living in the house and still married while we were paying on it, and she made the decision to leave.  So i'm just wondering if I'm the asshole for not wanting to give her that money?</td>\n",

       "      <td>My girlfriend has somewhat of a short attention span. Whether we're at home sitting on the couch or eating dinner together at a restaurant or just generally talking to one another, sometimes I'll start to talk and I notice that she isn't actually paying attention. Here are some of the signs:\\n\\n1. She's facing me but her eyes are looking at something around the corner, constantly shifting between me and whatever she's looking at, all the while saying, \"mhmm, yeah... uh huh\"\\n2. She randomly interrupts me to point out something unimportant and meaningless, e.g. \"OH! I didn't know this store was at this location! We have to go there soon. My bad, go on.\"\\n3. The infamous glued to cellphone texting someone else while trying to maintain communication with me.\\n\\nAnd the usual stuff like just zoning out, etc.\\n\\nNow I'm not an attention whore by any means. I've learned a lot about our relation the last few years and I know what interests my girlfriend and what I should talk to my friends about, but this isn't even a specific type of conversation here. We could be talking about how our day has been, in fact she could be the one asking me this question and when I answer, she will sometimes just stop listening to what I have to say. I've gotten used to it by now, so I'll even have a little fun with it sometimes. When I notice her drifting off, I'll make up silly stuff to see if she catches it, like, \"Yeah so Nancy got fired today at work because an elephant walked into our office asking if we sold oversized headphones it could wear and she said we don't.\"\\nOr I'll just prematurely finish what I had to say, like \"Yeah so Nancy... nah nvm it's not even important. How was your day?\"\\n\\nAnd now we get to the point. Recently, my girlfriend and I went to a coffee shop near by and sat down to enjoy ourselves. I started to talk about the marathon my friend joined and how we should give it a try but I noticed she was looking from the corner of her eye at this odd couple sitting next to us. She interrupts me mid sentence and says:\\n\\nGF: \"Honey don't we know those two people from somewhere?\"\\n\\nMe: \"I dunno\" and just stopped talking\\n\\nGF: \"Sorry, what were you saying?\" \\n\\nMe: \"Nothing, never mind\"\\n\\nGF: \"I said sorry, jeez. Why are you always like this?\"\\n\\nMe: \"What? I'm just not going to waste my energy talking when you don't care.\"\\n\\nGF: \"What's your problem?\"\\n\\nMe: \"Nothing, I'm just tired of being interrupted and ignored. Don't you think it's rude to do that? I always listen to you and anyone else that talks to me because I actually care, but sometimes you just don't care, so I don't care either.\"\\n\\nGF: \"Relax, I just wanted to know if you knew who they were. Why do you have to be so sensitive about this all the time? I'm listening to you.\"\\n\\nMe: \"Okay, so what was I talking about then?\"\\n\\nGF: \"Fine, whatever.\"\\n\\nThis has happened to me all my life because my family has always ignored me. Thus, I've always been courteous to other people by doing something as simple as listening to them when they talk. My girlfriend's closest friend and cousin is exactly like this and I've actually had arguments with them in the past about this type of thing being disrespectful to the person talking to you but they think it's trivial.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? Do I not have a point? I get that sometimes we all have thoughts in our heads that suck up all of our attention but this happens very frequently.\\n\\n**TL;DR Girlfriend has a short attention span, interrupts me when I'm talking because of something trivial and I can't stand it, so I stop talking.**</td>\n",

I do the whole \"Wow, you guys are so racist, not all of us are like that\" and things are getting louder as they are (jokingly but with conviction) that we all are and I feel a hand slap across my face and look up to see my girlfriend looking at me with a slightly remorseful face and her hand coming back to her side.

       "      <td>Throwaway because this is work-related. Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to be concise. \\n\\nI own and run a company together with three male partners. I'm the fourth partner, and female. A few weeks ago, I was trying to hand over an important project to one of my partners before I went on vacation. While I was briefing him, he interrupted me a number of times and went off on lengthy tangents - so often, and so lengthy, that it was becoming difficult to  give him all of the info he needed to complete the project without me. This bothered me, and I must have gotten snippy (I didn't realize it at the time), because when I left the room for coffee, he turned to another partner and said: \"Do you know what I would say to my wife if she spoke to me like that?\" And then proceeded to bark in that partner's face like an angry dog.\\n\\nI caught the tail end of this, and when he realized I had overheard, he repeated the whole thing, trying to play it off as a harmless joke. I was pretty taken aback and couldn't immediately compute what he had just said and what the implications were. I told him that I hadn't realized my tone was out of line, apologized, and that was that.\\n\\nNow, weeks later, his comment still irks me. Hardcore. This is blatant sexism, and it's in my innermost work circle, I own a business with these people. The problem is, because of my vacation, weeks have passed since it happened - and I haven't spoken to him about it. By now, I feel like the fact that I can't let it go is more a reflection of my own limitations - my white-hot anger when it comes to sexism and my inability to be chill about it - than of the crassness of the incident itself.\\n\\nOK, so here's the AITA. The fact that he said this has made me lose respect for him. I genuinely like him less, and I think it's starting to show in our daily interactions. I don't really enjoy talking to him, so I only strike up a conversation if I have to. The tone is always professional and polite, but I wouldn't say friendly, and the frequency of our conversations has dropped. And when he interrupts me now, I just keep on talking and bulldoze right over him. This especially has made him notice that something is going on, but since the incident happened a few weeks ago, he has no idea what he did wrong. \\n\\nI should add that I was brought on board explicitly to add structure/professionalism to the company. We work in a creative field and before I joined the team, it was kind of a crazy, non-productive free-for-all. I've been fairly successful in implementing discipline, but it's been a long and hard fight... Which has resulted in my being labelled as the company nag. This is the main reason why I haven't brought the issue up. It is absolutely vital that I pick my battles.\\n\\nI also believe that deep-seated sexism isn't something you can talk someone out of.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not explaining to my partner how sexist his comment was?\\n\\nTLDR: Was unable to immediately call out business partner about sexist comment, comment still bothers me, it's starting to creep into our daily interactions, but I still haven't spoken to him about it. Am I being a passive aggressive asshole?\\n\\nEdit: Changed first sentence to clarify that I am not an office manager, as some readers thought, but a partner.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**TL;DR my boyfriends good friend/flatmate is very passive aggressive and goes out of her way to control us (which she has some right to as it's her house). Am I a bad girlfriend for no longer making an effort to be friends when my boyfriend really wants everyone to get along? I used to be friendly but now I'm just civil and nothing more unless she talks first.**\\n\\n\\nI've been dating my boyfriend John for a month. His flatmate, Jane, is a good friend of his who he works with. When Johns ex dumped him Jane offered her house to him. She insisted that he not pay any rent and they agreed that he stay for roughly a month. That was in January. \\n\\n\\nWhen John first moved in Jane jumped him on the couch and tried to kiss him and initiate sex. John politely turned her down because he doesn't believe in sleeping with flatmates/coworkers. I'm honestly fine with this - I can understand being attracted to John :) I didn't even meet him until a month later. **I do not do anything \"couply\" with John in front of her. I have never kissed him or told him I liked him in front of her**. \\n\\n\\nJane and I were friendly at first but then she started becoming extremely passive aggressive. She suddenly refused to talk to either of us and would sometimes demand that we leave the house at 11pm because she \"wanted space\" and we couldn't come back until the next day... And even then John had to come back alone. On our first night as a couple she got drunk and started screaming on the phone at her friend about how much she hated John and wanted to live alone - she did this from like 8m away and knew we could hear her. I'm very conservative and shy around strangers so on the rare occasion she talks to me she likes to push subjects to try and make me uncomfortable, such as telling me to wear nipple tassels with her and discussing my breasts (her boyfriend I barely knew was next to her). \\n\\n\\nNow, I'm of the belief that whoever has the house makes the rules so we should just shut up and deal with it until John finds a new place. The thing is, I only visit once a week and Jane always holds that over Johns head. He has tried to pay her rent several times and each time Jane refuses but then tries to control him by saying \"no you can't do this/have your girlfriend visit because you don't pay any rent\". He always pays utilities though. Jane has also told John multiple times that she doesn't mind that he stay longer despite the initial agreement only being for a month. \\n\\n\\nEvery time Jane does something bad she apologises later and says she knows she's being unreasonable but then she goes and does it again. \\n\\n\\nJohn has been applying for new houses every day but been unsuccessful because our city has a huge housing crisis. Jane is still insisting that it's fine that he stay with her until then and that it's okay if I visit once a week (she always says it's fine but complains later, saying that she hates my laugh or she wanted space). \\n\\n\\nAfter this, I never ask to visit John unless John and Jane ask me. I have never been anything but polite to Jane's face (although I've told John I can't understand why he wants to be friends with someone who controls him when he's 27) and everytime I come over I smile genuinely and greet her but now neither of us bother with conversation. \\n\\n\\n**I'm NOT after a solution (obviously he needs to move out or I need to stop visiting when she says it's okay), I just want to know if I'm an asshole for not bothering to try and make things up to Jane when it's only been a measly month, considering he still wants to stay friends with her (everyone says she has a really nice side that I haven't seen) and I think girlfriends should always make an effort to be nice to people their boyfriends care about.**\\n\\nJohns abusive ex refused to meet his friends and family. When she finally met his friends at a work function she left without telling him because she was bored. He was humiliated. A year later she finally met his mother and constantly complained about how she was forced to be there and even left early alone to catch a 2hr bus to the airport to get home - they were only visiting for two days. I'm trying to help John to a better place after the shit his ex did and I'm worried that by giving up with Jane I am being like his ex. Yes, I know he has awful taste.</td>\n",

I wasn't really in  the mood for a discussion, so i just let it go.\\n\\nA few months later I finally decided to get the piercings done anyway and asked two of my friends to go to a piercer with me. The night before getting pierced I gave my boyfriend - who was in London for a language training week at that time - a heads up via WhatsApp. I knew he wasn't going to be thrilled, but his only response was along the lines of \"Well... if you think you'll look prettier :)\" Suprisingly positive, so I figured he'd be okay with it. I went ahead with it and got my ear pierced (conch and rook in case that's relevant).\\n\\nThe next day I visited my boyfriend. I had my hair in a ponytail, so the piercings were clearly visible. He didn't comment on them at all though, so I figured they didn't bother him too much. Turns out he didn't even notice them...\\n\\nFast forward a week: my boyfriend is staying at my place. I notice him staring at my new piercings. \"What the hell is that? Are those the new piercings? Why?\" and a few minutes later \"I can't even tell you how much I don't like them\" He's devastated. And I mean literally. He pleaded with me to take them out for about 10 minutes, after I refused he proceeded to sulk for good 30 minutes. I asked him why he didn't object before I got my piercings done, since if I took them out now the money I paid for them and the pain of a needle piercing through my ear would all have been for nothing. His response was \"Well, I was in London at that time...\"\\n\\nWhatever... I figured I'd just keep my hair down when he was aroud now, because if he can't see the piercings he's not going to complain about them, right? Well, not really... It worked for a while, but we were cuddling this morning and he pressed his head against my ear unintentionally. I said \"Ouch, you touched my piercings\" which sent him in sulk mode all over again. I decided that I wouldn't waste my Saturday by staying at my sulking boyfriends place. Before I left he said \"Get home safely. Oh, and I don't like that entire piercing thing at all\" \"Well yeah, I noticed\"\\n\\nThat's pretty much the whole story. And we're both 18 in case that's relevant. Am I the asshole here?</td>\n",

When I first got to the room there were no chairs and I stood for a few minutes. At some stage someone grabbed another chair and a seat became available so I sat in one.

       "      <td>So first I'll give you some background. I am a 22yr old male about to graduate college. This happened yesterday, mothers day, at work. I work at a restaurant in downtown chicago, and for those of you who don't know, mothers day is our second busiest day of the year, so I already wasn't in the best mood.  \\n\\nI work with my roommate and my girlfriend, me and my roommate work in the same section, and my girlfriend works as a hostess on the other side of the restaurant. There are 3 other important people in this story, coworker 1 (C1), coworker 2 (C2), and chef. \\n\\n\\nSo now to actually start the story. It was a hectic day at work and we had two new people working, which just made matters worse. When I first showed up I saw my roommate and gf whispering to each other, saying something like \"did you tell him yet?\". Me, knowing they were talking about me, asked them what they were talking about, and they just changed the subject. This happened about 1-2 more times that day, but I just kicked it to the back of my mind, as that day was very busy\\n\\n I could go into all the garbage I went through at work that day, but I will skip it to be concise. Basically, I wasn't in the best of moods at this time, but things were dying down and I was looking forward to leaving. I went in the back, and C1, my roommate, and the chef were all laughing in the back. When C1 saw me he shouted \"dumbass got her pregnant!\" my roommate then told him \"no she didn't tell him yet!\" At this point I was beginning to get flustered, and the chef and C1 were telling me what I should have done not to get my girlfriend pregnant, with C1 telling me what a big mistake it was when he had a baby at my age.\\n\\nThey continued to grill me, but I just stood there and took it, as there was someone up front I was helping get food for. I went back up front and took care of the customer, and my mind started racing with thoughts. Is she really pregnant? Why did she tell everyone else first? Needless to say, I start to freak out a bit. The only time me and her had talked about kids is when we talked about how much we don't like and don't want them. So I called her over, and the conversation went like this.\\n\\nMe: \"So people have been saying some things about you, is there anything you need to tell me?\"\\n\\nHer: \"Maybe\"\\n\\n*At this point my heart starts pounding, this isn't looking good*\\n\\nMe: \"well what does that mean? If you have something to tell me you can just tell me\"\\n\\nHer: \"not at work\"\\n\\n*I'm starting to freak the fuck out, the only reason she wouldn't want to tell me at work is if it was something serious.* \\n\\nMe: \"does it have to do with\" *points to uterus*\\n\\nHer: \"yes\"\\n\\n*my eyes grow wide, my hands start shaking, I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack*\\n\\nMe: \"are you pregnant?\"\\n\\nHer: \" yes, I'm pregnant\"\\n\\nI take a step back, as my brain starts to process the gravity of what she just said. I feel the adrenaline kicking through my body, I have no idea how to respond. I'm staring at her wide-eyed, when my roommate jumps out from behind the door, and they both scream\" surprise!\". This does not help with my anxiety, as my heart beats faster. My gf then says \" just kidding I wasn't really pregnant!\". My roommate \"yeah we got you!\". My mouth is open, blood is kicking and I cannot make words come out of my mouth. I say,\"I need to be alone right now\". I then go to the bathroom to try and calm down, be alone, and process. This feels like the start to a panic attack, but I calm myself down a little bit and go back up front. \\n\\nThere was a customer up there looking to place an order and throughout the conversation my words aren't coming out right, and I'm still flustered. When I hand him my pen to sign the check, I bump into him  because I can't controll my hand. I am obviously not calmed down yet. I go to the back and my roommate attacks me. \"Why are you being so weird?\", \"you should have known it was just a joke\", \"quit being a bitch\". To which I respond shut the fuck up, don't tell me how to feel, and you almost gave me a panic attack. He keeps trying to get in my face to force me to calm down, which was making me even more upset, and I tell him to watch upfront because I need to be alone right now, and cool off.\\n\\nAs I am going towards the bathroom again, my girlfriend intercepts me. \"Did I ever tell you how much I adore you?\" I can still feel the adrenaline pumping through me, and I just stare at her. She goes in to hug me and I am still freaking out, but I try to hug her back, which turns into a weird half hug. She gets upset with me and storms off. \\n\\nI then go back into the bathroom and cool off for about fifteen minutes, which helps, and then go back to finally finish my shift. I look for my gf to talk this out, but she already went home. Great. now she's mad at me. I later learn that this whole joke was orchestrated by C2, but it was supposed to go like this.\\n\\nHer: \"why haven't you wished me a happy mothers day?\"\\n\\nMe: \"why would I?\"\\n\\nHer:\"because I'm pregnant!\"\\n      \"just kidding!\"\\n\\n When I got off of work, I texted saying sorry that I got upset, but I was so flustered I couldn't say anything. no reply. So tell me, am I the asshole for responding how I did?\\n\\nTL;DR: coworkers and girlfriend pretend she is pregnant, I almost have a panic attack, turns out they were just kidding. Now everyone is mad at me.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to know if I'm the asshole in a fight that my boyfriend of three years and I are currently having. \\n\\nA little background: I just had a baby three weeks ago and am currently taking care of her mostly on my own while my boyfriend works and breastfeeding every two hours. I have mostly been camped out on the couch. Normally, I am working and my boyfriend has plenty of time alone to masturbate, and I have recently been privy to his habits a little more than I'm used to. I try to be understanding, since I am currently unable to have sex until six weeks postpartum. I am not against masturbation in any way - I masturbate and think it's healthy. I am, unfortunately, slightly bothered by porn use. I don't like to admit it, but it does irk me a little when I know he's whacking it to porn (he gets up in the middle of the night to do it). I have never said anything about it in the past, because I know guys are visual and masturbation is a different, more personal thing than having sex with your partner. He has a very high sex drive. I have also tried to continue being intimate with him and have given him a few blow jobs, maybe two a week or so, since coming home from the hospital. We normally have sex nearly every day. I am exhausted as well as sexually frustrated.\\n\\nThis morning I had to take the baby to the doctor. He knew this, but he was unsure of the time I was leaving. I was nursing her on the couch and he came out of the bedroom to get the laptop and went back into the bedroom, announcing that he was going to masturbate. This bothered me and I said in a frustrated tone, \"I'm leaving in an hour!\" thinking he could just wait until I left, which would be preferable for me because I don't really like sitting in the adjacent room awake while he masturbates, but also, I thought, to him, because he wouldn't have to feel bad about me sitting out there, he could have the sound on, or whatever.\\n\\nHe gets upset and I get upset back. I said, angrily, that he could just wait for me to leave and have time to masturbate to his favorite porn star all day! We argue and I leave, and I've been stewing all day about how selfish and insensitive he is. I say that he can be more sensitive to how I feel about him masturbating whenever and wherever since I am sexually frustrated and exhausted taking care of a baby and he says I have no right to tell him when or where to masturbate or what to do with his body. \\n\\nHe is also stuck on the fact that I don't like porn and is now saying I don't want him to masturbate ever, which isn't true. He says I can't say I don't want him to masturbate in the room next to me while I'm awake and then also say I'm okay with masturbation. He also says since I've never said anything about him masturbating to porn bothering me before that I am a liar and have not been upfront in our relationship. In reality, I have asked him to clear the history because I don't like to see what he masturbates to. I feel my dislike of porn use is irrational, so mostly I ignore it. I have never told him not to use porn and don't expect that from him at all... I just don't like thinking about him jerking it in the room next to me while I'm sitting there!\\n\\nHopefully this makes some sense - I probably rambled a little too much.

       "      <td>So this happened in the last few days; my husband, other cousins, my Mom and aunt are backing me up. What I want to know is what others have to say about this whole situation. I've never had any real bouts with family so, I'm feeling a bit caught off guard about all of this, if nothing else.\\n\\nSo here's what happened:\\n\\nMy Grandpa passed away recently (early April), relatively unexpectedly and tragically. I booked an emergency flight home from abroad as soon as I had news about funeral arrangements. I was home for about a week, just enough time to get settled in at home, be there for the funeral and spend sometime with family. Even though I had just been back in the States two weeks prior for a planned visit, original plans were suddenly changed with the deterioration in my grandpas health, landing him in the hospital twice in the last week and a half.\\n\\nLet me back up in potential build-up of drama by stating the following:\\n\\nOnce the news of his death came to me, having waited overnight, not to mention giving myself a chance to calm down as the news was hard to take as I was very close to my Grandpa, and he was my last grandparent, I changed my Facebook profile to the original picture of a 1952 portrait of my grandparents I have tattooed on my shoulder blade. I also changed my profile banner to a picture of my Grandpa with two of my favorite cousins and I during the last time I was in Georgia with my family (2008, the spring after my Grandma, his wife, has passed from Alzheimer's). Going to GA for Easter used to be a family tradition up until I'd say the last 12 years ago or so. Since then, it has become much more sporadic because of my Grandparents health slowly deteriorating as they aged (and public schools spring break not lining up with Easter any more).\\n\\nAnyway, moving on: shortly after changing my pictures, my aunt Tami (married to my Mom's brother), sent me a message that said \"OP:... My son doesn't know yet.\" To which I asked if she wanted me to change them. She said yes. I didn't.\\n\\nInstead, I replied that I didn't see what the problem was. I didn't post a status / any words about what had happened. I simply changed my pictures. I also noted that I wasn't even friends with her son on FB. She retaliated that there was still GA family that didn't know about what had happened and that FB wasn't the place for them to find out. I agreed, but reaffirmed that I only changed my pictures specifically for that reason. *No further correspondence.*\\n\\nThe weekend after the funeral, the family began work on Grandpas house to get it ready to put up for sale on the open market. As we began to start clearing it out for renovations, the majority of the family was there making piles of trash, donation, and keep. Having recently moved 4,000+ miles away to Germany, I opted not to keep much of anything save for a few sentimental items:\\n* Good Housekeeping cookbook 1969 (containing a few recipies I knew him and Grandma used)\\n* Family Genealogy book\\n* Military uniform, ribbons and medals\\n* Letters from Grandpa to Grandma while in the AF stationed in Germany circa August - February 1952 (my other cousin, Britt, kept the remainder of the stack of letters from 1953 and 1969).\\nI wanted to keep his military photo album too, but Mom said not yet. Of the few things I kept, I went through the house checking with every member of my family that they did not want the items I wanted. I always asked my uncle Mike first, as he was the eldest remaining child. No one had any objections.\\n\\nA few days after the clean up, I left to come back to my new home across the pond. Not a week after being back, my Mom was messaging me telling me not to be surprised if Tami sends me a message asking for Grandpas military medals. Confused, she explained that Tami and her daughter Sarah, wanted to make a special memorial display of the flag presented to Mike at the funeral and include Grandpa's original military medals and ribbons in his honor as a gift to Mike for Father's Day.\\n\\nUpon request (and without my knowledge), my Mom told Tami that she had the medals, but that they meant a lot to me and she would check with me before letting her have them. She also suggested to get duplicate medals and ribbons from and army surplus store. Unfortunately, this solution is not favorable by the requesting party. I'm not sure what happened after that, but I did not receive any correspondence from Tami.\\n\\nFast-forward to just the other day:\\nMy cousin Sarah (Mike and Tami's daughter), sent me a message again requesting Grandpas military medals and ribbons. She noted that her dad \"didn't ask for much when we were cleaning the house since he was just trying to hold it together.\" I responded cordially stating that I think the display is a wonderful and thoughtful gift idea for her father, but that I feel it is important the original medals and ribbons stay with his original uniform. I reinforced the purchase of duplicate medals and ribbons for Mike's display, as I wanted to make a shadow box display of my own showcasing Grandpas military memorabilia, and that it would look weird with new medals and an old uniform. Furthermore, I suggested incorporating his service certificates (which Mike actually *DID* want) into the display. Sarah said in her response message to me that she was, \"not trying to take Grandpas things from [me but is] trying to do something for [her] dad who's having a hard time.\" I replied to her, that I only took a total of 4 items the day of the initial clean and that while she isn't \"trying\" to take something from me, she *would* be taking a huge part of the 1 out of 4 things I have to remember our Grandpa by. I concluded the message by saying \"I hope you understand.\"\\n\\nHer only response: \"I don't at all.\"\\n\\nA few minutes later, she posts a status that says \"Wow how my eyes have been opened over the last month and a half!\" I \"liked\" it out of irony. She immediately sends me a message that says, \"Do me a favor and don't like my status. Delete me if you want. I just don't care anymore.\" One of her friends commented with concern about what the status was about. She replied simply stating \"People who only think about themselves.\" Clearly, the status is about me (should I make a point here that I am considerably younger than her?).\\n\\nI didn't condone her messages with a response but rather, a lack of action or response. \\n\\nWell Reddit, that's what happened. No words since. I'm not sure how to feel about this. Mostly I want to say \"fuck it,\" but I can't seem to let it go because 1) This is surprising to me and 2) Grandpa wouldn't want this and it makes me sad.\\n\\nStill though, I keep having to fight the urge to say something to her \\n\\nAM I THE ASSHOLE HERE?!</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is going to be a wall of text, so I apologize in advance.\\n\\nBack in college (almost 10 years ago) one of my husband's female friends was really into him. She made it clear a number of times she wanted him to leave me and be with her, including sending him a tape of her masterbating. It was really hurtful he continued to.be her friend for so long. Nothing physical happened between the two of them, but they did hang out. On one occasion he even forgot that we were meeting for lunch because I needed help carrying a lunch tray as I was walking with crutches due to a knee injury. He went to lunch with her because she was having a bad day while I waited around like an idiot. He didn't even call me, so I found this out that night when he got back from class. He said he felt bad for her because she found out she had MS and her boyfriend was a serial cheater, etc. I never told him he had to cut her out of his life because I don't think it is right to dictate who he spent his time with, even though it really hurt me. He even considered having us \"take a break\" when she told him she and her boyfriend were taking a break. I told him I loved him, but if he wanted to take a break to see where things could go with another woman than I considered it a break up. I told him I wanted him to be happy, but I would not sit around and be a doormat and wait for him while he slept with someone else.I would accept decision, but if he didn't chose me we were done. He chose me and eventually phased her out of his life.\\n\\n\\nI have forgiven him. We met young and he didn't expect to meet someone he would be so serious with when he did. I do.understand that, but he still treated me pretty horribly and while I have tried to let it go completely, the hurt doe creep up from time to time because it was such a tough time for me and really hits a sensitive, insecure part of me.\\n\\nWe have a great life a d a great married. We even survived the loss of our oldest daughter six days after birth to trisomy 18. We have two other daughters (2.5 years old and 10 months old). I had to get a hysterectomy because of pain and issues. This has been hard on me. Now I am making ovarian cysts on the one ovary I have left. The pain, disappointment and fear is causing me a lot stress (and physical pain). I may need to have this ovary removed, which will put me into full menopause and I am only 29. I can't do hormone replacement and this could shorten my life by 20 years. As we are waiting to get my prescription for pain medication and finding out I have to call my gynocologist to figure this all out, my husband goes, \"oh, hey, it was L's birthday and she mentioned she is pregnant with a little boy.\" I know she has a daughter to. I just said that was nice and I hope it means her MS is under control. I meant it to because I don't wish her ill. MS is a terrible thing for anyone to go through and she was young, scared and looking for a better man. What she did was wrong, but desperate people do desperate things. I can let that go.\\n\\nNow to the heart of it all. It. Bothered me that he is Facebook friends with her and knows what is going on in her life. It bothers me that he mentioned her because it feels like he brought her into our lives, even though it was something small. I was feeling nervous and in pain and he had to bring her up. It was frustrating, but I know it wasn't something done to be cruel. He just saw it and mentioned it like he does with so many other things.\\n\\nI took the opportunity to try to talk with him about it last night. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but when it was fresh we couldn't talk about it without tears and so much pain. I was curious about a few things and asked if he would be comfortable talking about it with me. He adMota what he did in college was wrong. He hates he caused me so much pain and was ashamed he did that to me, but it was the past and he was over it. Now, I don't want him to feel bad and ashamed forever, but he basically told me it doesn't ever bother him anymore because he is a different man and that I helped make him that better man. I get that and appreciate that he feels that way, but it bother me a bit that he doesn't feel ashamed about it at all now. It still was him who caused me that pain. I also wanted to know what it was about her than made her worth hurting me, what made him chose her over me so many times. He claimed that's not what he was doing. I explained that by going out and spending time with her knowing it hurt me, he decided to put her above me, that he valued spending time with her more and I wanted to understand what made him feel she was more worth it than I was. He swears up and down it isn't like that. That he doesn't quantify relationships like that. I tried to explain that when he choses to do something he knew would hurt me in order to do something for someone else thst he wasn't putting me first. He chose to make the other person more important. He kept insisting things don't work that way. It felt like her wasn't trying to see things my way and understand why it hurt as much as it did and how that insecurity is still with me today. He just kept insisting thst it wasn't like that. I told him it felt like he was bringing her into our lives by mentioning her. I explained that I needed his love and support because of what is physically going in with me and mentioning someone who caused me so much pain really hurt me. He asked if I wanted him to unfriend her. I told him that I would never tell him who to associate with and that was his choice (and I mean that). It's not like I think he is going to have an affair with her or that he is having long conversations with her. That said, it does hurt that he still has allowed her to be in his life, even in this incredibly minor way, because of the past history. I tried explaining that it hurt because she was a reminder of the troughest point in our relationship. He went on a rant how he never sees or talks to anyone from college. His best friend from college, who was like a brother to him, died 8 years ago from lymphoma  (we were there for him the whole time). I know it hurts him he doesn't spend time with anyone else from school. We have talked about it in the past. That said, this is a person who tried to convince him to leave me for her. She actively perused him and while he didn't have a physical relationship she, what he done could be seen as an emotional affair. I feel like not having any form of contact wit h her is a given. Apparently not. Hell, if he insists on being her friends for whatever resson, don't talk about her to me, especially when I am suffering depression and anxiety and physical pain. I mean, if something bad happened to her and she needed help I would be more okay with that because she doesn't have a lot of support. But why tell me about her life? If I had someone like that in my past (I don't, because no matter how many people tried to peruse me in high school and college, and there were a few who tried, I never did anything like that to him) I would not have any contact with them at all. Hell, I avoided the guy who asked me to a school dance (in college) because he knew I had a boyfriend and was still clearly trying to make a move on me out of respect for our relationship. I don't want to tell him he can't talk to her at all. I do trust him. It just hurts thst he doesn't even understand why this hurts me. We usually communicate very well, but it feels like he refuses to fully listen and see why this hurts me. I finally got so frustrated I told him just to forget about it. He asked this morning if I am still upset over it and I told him that I am. I am working on letting it go, but it all really hurts me, especially that he can't understand why it hurts me so much.\\n\\n\\nSorry if this is long and confusing. I am.on my phone and was trying to type this out while one kid rested and the other was on the potty. \\n\\nAm I an asshole for being hurt that my husband mentioned someone who tried to steal him away in college is having another baby while we were leaving a difficult doctor's appointment?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Alright, that title may have been misleading, but you're all only getting my side of the story here so I want to make sure I paint a very clear picture.\\n\\nFive and 1/2 years ago, I had a baby with a man that I married.  He was 19, I was 21.  He came from a family with very detached parents, I came from a loving, close-knit family.  We were very much the products of our upbringing.  We stayed together until she was ten months old.  During that ten months he was rarely around.  He would stay out until he knew I had her put to bed for the night.  He couldn't stand the sound of her crying, he would never allow himself to be left alone with her.  Looking back as an adult, it is very clear he was young, inexperienced and terrified.  At the time, I was also young and inexperienced, and didn't understand why he couldn't just love and spend time with our daughter.\\n\\nHe left when she was ten months old, letting me know that I could contact him for child support but he wasn't interested in raising this child.  Once he moved out, I didn't let him move back in, but when he came around feeling sorry for his actions, I wanted him to see our daughter so I allowed visits.\\n\\nAfter the first couple of visits, he started coming later and later and eventually began showing up after she was in bed.  When I realized he was visiting ME instead of HER, I put a stop to it.  He became angry and again told me that he didn't want to have anything to do with the child.\\n\\nThis time, I decided there were no take-backs.  From my point of view, I didn't want my daughter to deal with a father that was in-and-out of her life. By this time, she was only a year old, but eventually she would grow up and I never wanted her to hear her own father say outloud that he wanted nothing to do with her.\\n\\nWe went through the court for our divorce that year.  Having never actually been left alone with our daughter, he was given supervised visitation once/week through a facility in our county.  He attended the first few times and then just stopped showing up.  He didn't even show up to the last two divorce/custody hearings and they ended up finalizing it without him present.  \\n\\nNow my daughter is 5 and 1/2.  I've always been honest with her about the situation to an age-appropriate level.  (You used to have another daddy, but he knew he wasn't very good at being a daddy so he went away so that your life could be filled with love and joy.  Then it was just you and me for a while until we met _[my husband]__ and now he takes good care of you.)  She loves her step-dad, knows he isn't her biological father but she wants to call him Dad anyway.  She is happy and healthy and thriving.\\n\\nMy ex recently contacted me to ask if we could get together outside of court so he could get to know her.  I didn't even text him back.  As I said before, my child is happy and healthy and I don't want a sudden new daddy to fuck that up for her.  My theory is that since he chose when to leave, I'll let HER choose when they meet up.  I plan to give her the choice when she is older and I feel she is  mature enough.  \\n\\nWe come from a small town, he still talks to friends of friends of friends of mine.  Word has come back to me that people now thing I am this horrible bitch, witholding this poor man from seeing his daughter even when he is repenting for his actions.  \\n\\nI honestly don't even see him as \"the asshole\" except for the spreading of his pity party.  I see him as a troubled teen who got scared and couldn't handle the task of raising a child.  Up until now, I had actually been thankful to him that he made the choice to leave instead of making her early years harder.  \\n\\nSorry for the long post, but I feel it was all relevant to understand both sides.  AM I the asshole?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Okay so it's the custom at my school that the weekend after prom a group of friends rents a house by the shore and drinks, parties and conducts general debauchery. Prom is Saturday night and the bus for prom houses leave right after prom, and generally most people come back on the bus Tuesday night. \\n\\nAnyway, my group's prom house started forming around early October, when I submitted an initial deposit of $21 to the girl running it - let's call her Eileen. About a month later I met my current girlfriend and started dating her, problem is she wasn't from my town and people generally don't allow people who are juniors or out of town to come down to the prom houses. However there are instances where other people outside of the designated prom house come down for a bit. \\n\\nSo I submitted another deposit around January of $118 (although I actually gave her $120 because of ATM withdrawal) A little after this time my gf asked what we were gonna do after prom and I said I didn't know, she was kinda distraught that she wasn't going to be able to hang out with me after prom at all and I realized it was kinda fucked so at this point I told Eileen I'd go down Sunday morning (after spending Saturday night with gf) and I'd find a ride down to the shore house. I also needed to do a presentation Wednesday so I said I'd get a ride back late Monday night with one of the other people who are going back Monday night (there's lots). No problems there.\\n\\nFast forward to February, Eileen requests $118 ($120 again due to ATM withdrawal)again along with $70 for food and alcohol. She said this was the last payment and I was fine with that, albeit hesitant about paying that much for alcohol since I'm not a heavy drinker. \\n\\nWell, a few weeks ago, she says we need to pay $54 each for the bus. I figure I'd get a discounted rate since I'm only going from the pre-prom location to prom in the bus, the rest I'm gonna do myself. She told me nope and that it's $54 for both my girlfriend and I even though neither of us are taking the bus to the actual prom house (the extent of the cost). Now I was pretty upset about this not gonna lie. \\n\\nSo it's the week before prom and I got surgery Monday and the results came back that I can't drink at all this weekend so I asked Eileen to re-apportion my alcohol money to food instead. She said it was too late for that and I still needed to pay for the bus. The problem here is that the food we have is very minimal, only easy mac, ramen and various snacks and water. No burgers, no hot dogs, no nothing. Yet there are 28 people in the prom house and we gave her $70 EACH for alcohol AND food. Plus there's at least one other person who hasn't paid for the bus yet and he told me she hasn't said anything to him. He's also closer friends-wise with her, although when I brought it up she did say he would have to pay for the bus. But he's a heavy drinker and using the bus to get down to the shore house. Then she said if I refused to pay for the bus I would have to formally apologize in the Facebook group because she wouldn't have enough money to buy food that people want.\\n\\nAt this point I had an outburst because I said the food should have already been covered at this point and my bus money should have nothing to do with that, and that I'm already paying for alcohol which I won't be drinking, 3 nights for the house when I'll only be staying for 1; and now a bus I'd only use for a 15 minute ride from pre-prom to the actual prom event. \\n\\nOh also she suggested the idea of having her college Freshman friends come down to drink with us and then drive some people back Tuesday morning. This angered me too because she's cool with allowing them to come down whenever but not my significant other when I've deposited all this money already.\\n\\nAnyway Reddit I'll be happy to clarify anything for you to determine if I'm the asshole or not. Should I drive my date to prom in my car? Should I pay her and suck it up? Should I continue to insist my way on to the bus for 15 minutes without paying? \\n\\nEdit: Forgot this bit -  Apparently she did some mismanagement with money and some people gave her less than she had asked for in some cases but she never counted. If I'm supposed to feel bad for her fronting money because she didn't keep track of the expenses and the amount she was given - I don't. I'm not going to cover anyone else and I think it should be fair that I get to go to the bus for prom at least. She said at the start of all this it would be $220-230 per person for the house if we had 24 people; currently we have 28 and it was $236 per person for just the house.\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: oh and earlier in the year she told me stories about how she overcharged people for alcohol since she had a fake and it was easy.</td>\n",

We do it, start eating, need condiments, so I get up and accidentally run into the highchair. I would call what I did a nudge, it tips over and in a split second my husband grabs it by the handle, saving the baby from falling to the ground (at the time I was speechless, just impressed, but he's got damn good dad reflexes). I don't think the baby would have been hurt, but it would have been jarring. \\n\\nEveryone's frozen because of the clatter, and the first thing he does is call the woman a dumb ass, loudly, semi calmly. She's nearby and just stares at him. I'm calming the baby and he goes on, almost shouting, saying how she recommended that position and she's a dumb ass. I'm a quiet, nonconfrontational person, and I'm honestly a little horrified. \\n\\nThe manager comes over and he tells her what happened. I think she was apologetic but trying to get him to stop yelling. He demands to-go materials, and as he's getting them a bystander is staring. He says how ya doing maam and she says not great.

We leave, but after he exits he changed his mind and hours back in to spit at the looky lou's feet.\\n\\nWe get: the car and he asks how I feel, and I say I don't want him to be angry with me. Two years leak out of my eyes. He encouraged me to express my feelings, and I say I'm embarrassed and I feel bad for that woman. He does get angry at me and calls me a pussy.

I wasn't given a guest +1 for the event, despite the fact that my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other as long as she's been seeing this guy. (Not that she moved fast or anything.)\\n3. My previously mentioned girlfriend works in the airline industry and I haven't seen her in about 10 days. She'll be flying back in on the evening of the wedding (which again she wasn't invited to.)\\n4. Her and I have never been particularly close. We're friends on Facebook and all but I don't even have her number. She's from one of the other \"cliques,\" I suppose. When she notified me I wouldn't be receiving a guest for the reception, she did so via Facebook message. \\n5. Her mom, who is my aunt, have a lot of bad blood.

That's the basics out of the way. \\n\\nAfter a year of dating I asked to meet her dad, she said no way not until I have a college degree. I didn't think much of it at the time but as we dated I really started working hard to finish and graduate. I am now just under a year off of graduating with a degree in Public Relations and I asked her if we could sit down and talk about where each of us are at in school. How she feels about in the future possibly sharing an apartment (makes sense financially), and also me meeting her father. \\n\\nShe got angry and shot me down, saying that she wouldn't even talk to me about it.

I'm a long time lurker and hope I can get some honest advice. \\nTo give a little background my boyfriend and I just graduated high school together and have been with each other for about a year now. He's always been pretty against me going to parties or touching anything other than weed(I smoke regularly and since our relationship has gone on hes gotten quite into it himself.) And I've done my best to respect that and have bitten my tongue countless times because he's told me \"I can't\" go do things or be around certain people because he doesn't approve for some reason, or he's jealous of them. I've tried acid and shrooms once and have experimented with painkillers and alcohol pretty heavily in the past. I ended up getting arrested and really saw my life for what it was, moved hours away, quit drinking and experimenting, mended my bad relationships with my family, graduated a year early, and am enrolled in college next semester. I'm so much happier with myself and don't really see the need to try other things that I know will harm my body becuase theres more to life than getting fucked up. Hes told me in the past that he's not comfortable with the drugs ive done and that he would break up with me without a  second thought if I ever touched cocaine or acid, which I think is pretty reasonable. I don't exactly want him into those things either. He's recently found a new group of friends and says he doesn't want me around them because, they're \"not accepting people\" and even had a birthday party that he didn't tell me about or invite me to with all of them the other day. A few daya ago he told me that he wanted to try cocaine and that we should do it together. I am not comfortable with cocaine at all and told him that. He says his friends were on it a few days before and they just looked so happy. I said I wasn't really comfortable with his friends doing cocaine around him. Last night he was staying over and his friend called him and asked him to come try cocaine, this made me very uncomfortable and I said \"I'm not sure if I like your friends, they seem like bad influences on you and I know you'd tell me the same thing. I'm just not comfortable with it.\" He starts to ignore me even being in the room until he finally tells me that I way too judgmental and that he's not staying at my house. I offered to let him sleep in my bed and I'd go on the couch and we could drop the situation right now. I beg him to just talk to me about it while he literally completely ignores my presence until saying that \"talking never works\" and things to that nature. I tried to stress that communication is pretty much the most important thing in a relationship and that we obviously need to talk about this problem. I said what I said because I'm not comfortable with hard drugs and feel like he's choosing his friends over me not because I'm trying to be judgemental. He then left with the friends that called him and probably did cocaine. \\nTL;DR boyfriend who was against drugs gets a call and decides he wants to go do cocaine. That's a little shady and I say that. I'm mean and judgmental and should beg him to come back.</td>\n",

It's a big open floor with a barrier up front. You can't reserve a spot anywhere. If you leave your spot, you do not get it back if you change your mind.\\n\\n This was an all day festival (Summer Slaughter 2014) and my girlfriend and I had spent a pretty long time trying to get a spot up front at the barrier. We got up there just in time for the headliner, and the woman next to me was *very* drunk. She spent the entirety of the previous set jabbing her elbow into my rib cage (issue number 1). As soon as the final set started, she tried grinding on every guy around us, and grabbing at all of our crotches (issue number 2).\\n\\nSuddenly she turns around and leaves, someone else takes her place against the barrier, so we thought we were done dealing with her. A little while later, she decides she wants her spot back, so she comes back up, puts her hands on the barrier on either side of my girlfriend, and squeezes as hard as she can (issue number 3). I offered to switch places with my girlfriend so she could enjoy the show, but she said she'd rather be squeezed than have some random drunk chick grabbing my johnson. Fair enough. My girlfriend is not a big girl (5'2, 115 pounds) and she was clearly in a lot of pain. \\n\\nI tried asking a security guard for some help, but during the headliner of the show they were too busy catching crowd surfers to notice.\\n\\nTo solve this, I would throw my head in her direction while headbanging, hoping a face full of sweaty hair would make her want to leave. When it didn't, I forcibly pulled her hands off of the barrier and away from my girlfriend. When she kept putting her hands there and trying to squeeze the life out of my girlfriend, I turned around and screamed \"There is no room for you. Leave.\" in her face. She then turns to my girlfriend and asks if she wants to go outside to fight her (issue number 4). \\n\\nI again looked for security guards to help, but they were still all too busy.\\n\\nEventually, I'm tired of all of this. Being groped, jabbed with her elbows, her hurting my girlfriend, asking her to fight, and continuing to do this even though I, and everyone else around me, had told her to stop and that there just wasn't enough room for her, especially considering that *she* was the one that decided to give up her spot, and *we weren't even the ones that took her spot*. So the next time I turned around, I \"accidentally* elbowed her in the nose. \\n\\nShe still continued doing what she was doing, until finally a security guard caught on to what was happening, and pulled her off the floor.\\n\\nWas what I did going too far?</td>\n",

My girlfriend's parents and sister are currently visiting her in the UK, and will be there for 2 weeks. The problem is that my girlfriend feels that she should not be on her phone talking to me while her family is there, since it would be rude to them. I completely agree with that sentiment, because it would be rude to ignore her family like that. However, her family is staying at a hotel about 15 minutes by bus away from my girlfriend's apartment, so my gf and her sister have to take a bus there and back every day. In her city, the buses have wifi on them, so I asked her if she could talk to me while she is on those buses every day. But she said that would be rude to her sister (who is staying at her apartment instead of the hotel), so she can't. She asked one of her friends, as well as her parents and her sister, and they all agreed with her. Basically, they are all saying that I should trust her enough to let her not talk to me for the next 2 weeks.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting her to talk to me? Should I just let her not talk to me for the two weeks to appease her and her family/ friends?

       "      <td>Hey guys, my first post, so here goes nothing:\\n\\nThis happened this morning, just a few minutes ago.\\n\\nI was on my way to work, stopped at the convenience store on the other side of the parking lot from work, and my girlfriend (who also works with me) came with.  On our way over a coworker, we'll call her Bethany, got my girlfriend's attention and asked about trivial stuff while I paced ahead of them, not wanting to get involved.  When my GF told me to slow down because I was walking too fast, I told her (loud enough that she could hear me, about 20 feet away) that she was talking to Bethany and I \"didn't want to have anything to do with that.\"  My girlfriend knows the past stuff that has gone on between Bethany and I, and knows that I do not like this person.\\n\\nAnyway, I went into the convenience store and Bethany followed us in.  I think she came up to me first, came behind me while I was at the counter, and said, \"That was highly inappropriate,\"  I said back, \"Well I'm not going to be rude to you at work, but outside of work...\"  I believe it was then that she came up to my girlfriend and said that, \"You better tell your girl that if I ever hear my name pass her lips again, I'm going to fucking kill her.\"\\n\\nNow, my GF and I sat down for a little while, eating our breakfast sandwiches that we bought, and she told me that, \"Sometimes the things I say are so embarassing.\"  This is when she told me that Bethany had threatened my life.\\n\\nLet me give you a little back story, so you know the context.\\n\\nI've been working here for about a year, and the first cubicle I was assigned to I sat immediately behind Bethany.  I knew who she was because I had seen her on the bus before (gotta love mass transit, right?) and I tried to become friends with her, since that's always my reaction to meeting new people.  She would have good days and bad days, and to be honest, my humor tends towards dry sarcasm.  Everyone else that I interract with at work gets the same, but only she seems to take it personally.  The incident that prompted her first threat against me was very mild, I thought.\\n\\nWe have a rule at work that cell phones are not to be out and used.  If a supervisor sees you with a cell phone then they will pass that along to your supervisor and then they will possibly take disciplinary action against you.  On this particular day, I had gotten up to use the bathroom and on my way back she startled hard, because she was on her phone and scared that it might be a Sup and not a coworker who had seen her breaking the rules. I appologized for startling her, and sat down and went back to work.  The next time it happened again.  This time, as I passed her and she freaked out, I said that maybe if she didn't have her cell phone out, she wouldn't be so startled by people walking past her.  When I sat down she said, very quietly, that she would beat me up after work.\\n\\nShe didn't.  But ever since that day I have actively tried to avoid being in the same place at the same time.  Obviously sometimes, like this morning, it is unavoidable.\\n\\nI brought this to the attention of my union, but the entire thing still makes me think that I may have somehow overreacted when I said, within earshot of Bethany, that I didn't want to have anything to do with her.  Should I have been more meek about this?\\n\\nTL;DR: Coworker that has a history of threatening me took it to the max this morning when she told my girlfriend (who was with me) that she would \"fucking kill me\".  This was right after I had said to my girlfriend (within earshot of this coworker) that I didn't want to have anything to do with the conversation she and this coworker were having together.

If it's important for me to describe \"both sides in detail,\" I have to mention that he and I hadn't had the same afternoon off in quite a while and I'd been asking him to ball with me for over a year!\\n\\nThe local park near his new apartment was the perfect spot for a game. Public pool, HUGE playground and jungle gym, soccer field, and a full covered, regulation sized basketball court. \"Wanna warm up with a game of horse?\" I ask. He agrees, and we start shooting, running, and rebounding. We keep it half court, because a 50-something father and his teenage children had started a two-on-two game of their own on the other side.\\n\\nBy the time my bf accumulates an H, O, and R (I had less; ball is life), a tall 30-something father walks into the court area, straight towards our basket with his two sons. The older son could not have been more than FIVE years old. His younger brother, still all bald-headed with his natal-headed self, could not have been more than TWO years old. My boyfriend and I stop, double take both each other and the scene as the dad says to his children \"Go ahead, guys. Take some shots.\" It takes the 5YO attempting two or three shots with a MINIATURE foam basketball that fail to reach even two feet below the REGULATION SIZED basket for my boyfriend and I to dribble around the three point line whispering to each other \"What do we do?\" The dad registers our reaction and calls out \"Hey guys, you can keep shooting!\" Sure, sir. Can't wait to see how you react if one of our shots accidentally bricks off the hoop and slams into your tiny child's tiny child mouth. We try to take shots, and it's impossible. The kids are up against the basket (still 0 PPG by my count), and we feel uncomfortable playing at our previous, desired speed. \\nCool dad sees us again discussing our options on the sidelines (which, I'll be honest, was me hissing at my boyfriend to not let the dad hear our laments outloud), and he says \"Y'all can keep going! We didn't mean to interrupt anything!\" The bf and I are not combative people, so after less than 10 minutes of total game play, he and I leave the park and walk back home.\\n\\nOne the walk back home he and I furiously threw out sentences to pinpoint why we felt so shitty about what just happened. \"In any neighborhood basketball court ANYwhere, dibs are dibs.\" \"Agism? He didn't try interrupting the OTHER family's game. Would he have done that if we were both grown men?\" \"What were we gonna do? Call out this dude in front of his children?\" \"THE FUCK ARE CHILDREN GONNA DO ON REGULATION SIZED SHIT?!\" We agreed the appropriate response could have been \"Sir, we were in the middle of a game. Would you like us to give you ten or so minutes to shoot around?\" but Are We the young childless Assholes for getting so angry at Cool Dad?</td>\n",

Now he has to turn the plates to his car in and where he lives can only park it on a public road where it will get towed without the plates on it.

If anything is unclear please let me know and I'll try to clarify.\\n\\nI am 23 years old, recently graduated from college, and currently living with my mother on the East Coast (USA). If it matters my parents are divorced and I am not living under my father's roof. Recently my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together in California. This is a good move for me career-wise because I want to work in the biotech/pharma industry.\\n\\nI ask my father for advice frequently but he also gives a lot of unsolicited advice. He says that this is because he has an analytical problem-solving nature that he can't shut off. He  thinks that I need to have interviews lined up in CA before moving there, otherwise I will drain my savings.\\n\\nIdeally I'd love to have interviews lined up before moving but I personally don't think it's realistic. Companies often don't take applicants seriously if their address is on the other side of the country. I did apply to a lot of CA jobs during spring and never heard back from any of them. I was afraid that if I applied to more with my East Coast address it would be a waste. My father then suggested I put down an address of someone I know in CA, but I'd have to be able to fly down for interviews on short notice, which would also drain my savings.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I picked out a short-term lease apartment and he is willing to cover rent and other costs of living until I am employed. We made a budget. I have $8000 in savings that will be used on the security deposit and my plane ticket. The rest will be emergency funds. I do not expect my father to bail me out financially under any circumstances. I am not moving to CA for around a month, but I have started applying to jobs using the apartment's address. My father wanted me to have interviews lined up before choosing an apartment.\\n\\nI fully explained my reasoning to my father and I can explain more of my reasoning if anyone asks. I do understand my father's concerns and I know he's trying to look out for me. I told him that I took time to think on his advice but I am not going to follow it and I would like to stop discussing it. He got angry and told me that was a very disrespectful thing for me to say.\\n\\nMy father thinks I was just too lazy to apply for jobs early because people in my generation have lazy attitudes. He said he felt it was his duty to \"slap that attitude in the face\". I found this very hurtful because I'd applied to tons of East Coast jobs before deciding to move to CA, so I'm clearly not too lazy to apply to jobs. At this point both of us were raising our voices. \\n\\nAt 9:40 during the argument I told him I needed to leave soon to feed cats I was pet sitting by 10:00. He wouldn't drop the argument and I reminded him I needed to leave several times. The cats have special diets and need medicine, so by 10:40 I walked away from the argument, telling him I was already 40 minutes late to feed them. This is especially where I'm worried I was the asshole. But in my opinion it's definitely an asshole move to not feed the cats.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I told my father that when he gives me unsolicited advice I will always listen and consider it. But if I end up choosing not to follow his advice I want him to respect my decision. His response was that this is very disrespectful to him. I ended up walking out mid-argument because I was pet sitting cats with special dietary needs and was already 40 minutes late to feed them. My father was aware that I had this responsibility. I am 23, not living under my father's roof, and not depending on him financially. AITA for choosing not to follow his advice and/or leaving the argument to feed the cats?</td>\n",

       "      <td>My boyfriend rented out a room in his house to his best friend \"John\" and John's girlfriend \"Anna\". John and my boyfriend work away from home frequently, so it was mostly me and Anna. The house belongs to my boyfriend and we all paid the same rent.\\n\\nAnna was not cut out for roommates. She left huge messes all over the house (dirty sports equipment, clothing) and would render shared spaces unusable for hours (using the living room to Skype her family, taking 2 hours in the bathroom when everybody else was getting ready for work). She also had it out for me. If I so much as left a dish in the sink, she would call my boyfriend to tattle on me. She would get mad at me for not washing the dishes she used to cook herself a 4-course meal and thought I wasn't \"doing my share\". I cooked my own food and washed my own dishes...\\n\\nEventually, I told Anna to chill out and stop complaining. She was the only person who ever complained, out of four people sharing the house. She did not take kindly to this and decided that she and John were moving out ASAP.\\n\\nShe and John moved out while my boyfriend and I were on vacation. I cleaned the entire house before we left, and when I got back the house was a disaster. There was garbage all over the floor, molasses spills on the hardwood and they had taken all of our toilet paper, so I couldn't even pee at home after a 15 hour plane ride at 1am. They had also left dirty dishes PILED in the sink and the garbage can overflowing onto the floor.\\n\\nMy boyfriend was off at work and didn't have to clean the mess (I did). He also decided that John could continue to use our garage and shed as a storage space (even though they don't pay rent and have their own garage, but that's none of my business). John and Anna kept one of our house keys so they could access the house where the garage key is kept.\\n\\nAnna is over at the house at *least* every two weeks, and she only comes when the house is empty. The first time, she let my puppy escape the house. He was 12 weeks old and 1.5lbs. The second time, beer cans spilled from her trunk and she left them there in the yard. Then yesterday, she gave the house key to her brother and told him to pick up her golf equipment. I got home and the driveway was blocked by him, so I had to park on a different street than where I live. \\n\\nI asked my boyfriend to either take the key back, or tell Anna that she can only come over when I am home. I said I knew it was his house, but I lived there too and I felt uncomfortable with Anna having unlimited access to my possessions and pet because she had proved that she doesn't respect the space. She was also handing the keys around to other people and every time she came, she caused a huge inconvenience (cleaning up after her, not having a place to park, MY DOG ALMOST GETTING AWAY).\\n\\nBoy, did that go over poorly. My boyfriend told me \"It's his house and he trusts his friends\". I said he shouldn't, because she almost got our dog killed and I have to clean up every time she comes over. He said \"This is how it is, I'm not changing anything just because you complain. My house, my rules. Get over it. I'm not going to tell my best friend that I don't trust him\".\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not wanting disrespectful people coming in and out of where I live willy-nilly? I just want them to be more considerate if they're going to use all the available storage space for free...</td>\n",

The bus she usually takes normally arrives a little after midnight. In the past, either myself, or more typically my husband, go to pick her up. The bus depot is only a fifteen minute walk from my home, but since it's late at night, we don't like her walking alone. We've done this maybe 7 or 8 times prior.\\n\\nOn the night in question, a few things were different. First, my husband and I were both very ill with a cold, and we were both taking Nyquil/Sudafed/whatever we could find. Second, a blizzard had made the roads very treacherous, and we hadn't yet had the opportunity to put the winter tires on the truck. Because I found it unsafe and unwise for either of us to drive tired, sick, on drugs, during a blizzard, I texted my sister earlier that evening and asked if she would please take a cab instead. She said no problem.\\n\\nCue my mother calling me ten minutes later in an absolute fury. She accuses my husband and I of being horribly selfish and cruel for leaving my sister alone at the bus depot when we could so easily drive and get her. I explained my position and reasoning, but she was livid and wanted to hear none of it. I asked what damn business was it of hers, when this entire exchange was between my sister and I to begin with. This... did not help defuse the situation.\\n\\nThe conversation devolved into a screaming match and we ceased speaking to one another for some days. When my sister found out, she was shocked, and felt very torn between my mother and I.\\n\\nWe've since smoothed things over, but my mother still maintains her position, and I believe I was correct.\\n\\nSo, who (if anyone) was the asshole?</td>\n",

       "      <td>First I want to list the people that are involved in this situation. First off there's the main girl we'll call her M (I will also refer to M and \"her\") then there is the guy we'll call him D(I will also refer to D as \"him\"), there is another girl that I had a thing with we'll call her H, my ex is also apart of this story we'll call her S, and of course me. We are all in high school although D is a grade higher than me and M. M and I have been friends for about 6 months now and I have grown to like her a lot. We have similar personalities and have gone through a lot of the same shit in life, making it very easy for her and I to sympathize with each other on most everything.\\n\\nIn the beginning of our friendship I was talking to and pursuing H, I had no idea that M might like me at all. Eventually the thing with H fell through. After it fell through I had a conversation with M, where I learned that M liked me before she knew I had a thing with H, she then told me that she no longer liked me and had moved on. After this I started dating S and M started to have a thing with D, I was happy in my relationship and I was happy for her.\\n\\nLong story short I broke up with S and decided that I was done with relationships for awhile. I was still happy for M and D they never officially started dating but they were happy together and what did I care. As school ended and summer began M and I were talking and Skyping a lot, during these conversations we grew very close. I learned that her best friend and her were having a fight and weren't really talking. So in away I became her person she talk to. \\n\\nIn the middle of summer M and D hadn't gone on a signal date or seen each other, the last time they had seen each other was the last day of school. M had told me that she wasn't really interested in dating D and only wanted to be good friends with D but didn't want to push D away so she said nothing to him about being just friends. So at this point I thought that they weren't dating and that she didn't like him. One day we were texting and she mentioned that she had just had an amazing day with D at a local theme park, I guess this \"date\" had changed her feelings for him. I started to ask questions about her day and what it was like. What I found out is that M and D aren't officially \"dating\" but they have a \"thing\" whatever that means. \\n\\nThe next day we were Skyping and I told her that I liked her and that I have feelings for her, M told me that she likes me as well but she also likes D at the same time, she said that she knows that its a bad thing to feel and that it wasn't fair to either me or D. We continue our conversation like nothing happened. In other Skype conversations I tried to bring up the whole topic of her liking me and D, but most of the time she would avoid the question or talk about something else. The one time that I did get her to talk about it was when she listed the pros and cons of both me and D. Both me and D had about the same Pros (She says that we're very similar, I don't know him to well), my one con was that I wasn't in her friend group and D's one con was that he was a year older than her. Neither of these cons being that bad.\\n\\nMoving this long story up to just a few days ago. While I was texting her she seemed kinda out of it and wasn't really in the conversation, if that makes any sense. Anyways I asked her what was on her mind and she replied with a wall of text. This wall of text basically said that M was feeling pathetic because she can't face anything coming towards her (I'm assuming she meant the situation with me and D) M also said that I really likes D but he tries to fix everything and be her shrink but all she wants him to do is to listen but she doesn't think he capable of just listening. She went on and said \"And you, oh you are just, basically perfect, and that's actually really annoying because I want to just like D and be done with it but I can't because when I talk to you it reminds me of what he isn't. And I hate that. I really don't like it. But it's there. And I don't know what to do with it. And I feel awful for feeling that, because it's not fair to either of you.\" Honestly, I don't know what to take from this part of the text, but now you're caught up to present day, My question is am I the asshole For wanting her to be with me and just go up to her and ask her to be my girlfriend and not be with D ?  Feed back and questions are welcome.\\n\\nTLDR: She likes him and me and has told me this, I like her ( I have told her this) and want her to be with me and not him.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm going to try to summarize because it's a LOOOONG story.\\n\\nI lived in a different state with my husband and daughter and my own two cats. My Mom bought a house in this state a while back but moved out of it to live with her boyfriend- she offered to give me the house. \\n\\nThe deal as -I- remember it is that we were going to take care of her six cats until she bought a bigger house with her boyfriend. One of the cats was my late great grandma's cat. I agreed to these terms. Later on she said that her small annoying dog was included in this deal. I had no recollection of this being part of it but she insisted that it had always been the deal. (Later found out that when she changed it was the same time she got a new dog - which brought her to the two-pet cap at her boyfriends house (because she brought her other dog with her there))\\n\\nI reluctantly agreed- I was having a difficult time at the place I was staying (invited 'friend' to live in a spare room and she became hostile and refused to do anything to support herself or the household- different AITA I guess). Anyway I wanted ou bad because I didn't want to kick this chick and her baby out so I figured I would just leave. \\n\\nWe get out here and everything is worse than i remember her telling me (house is in worse shape, animals are VERY badly behaved etc) but we get to work. It ended up being four cats (not sure how my math got skewed but I'm telling it as I remember it) because she had already taken one to her place before we got there, plus the stupid dog. \\n\\nIn the first few months, one of the cats ran off through a hole I the house that we did not know existed. We still have not found the cat but we did cover up the hole. Gradually she begins taking animals- first one of the other cats, because it did nothing but howl and howl constantly because none of the damn cats were fixed. She paid to get that cat and one other cat fixed. The last cat (GGC) had already been fixed. My mom and I converse occasionally about the possibility of me keeping the last two cats. She got her new place and after like two months she finally took the dog after us Begging and begging because this dog was a pain in the ass and peed and pooped all over and whined constantly really loudly. I fully agree to take one of the cats but leave GGC up in the air. \\n\\nIn between this stuff we rescue a dog and two kittens off the street. We wanted to keep them but ended up finding them good homes instead because it was too much for us to handle. \\n\\nI continue to ask when mom plans to take GGC, and she keeps putting it off, and I say that she needs to go to the vet. An appointment is not made until I casually suggest calling HER mom about it instead (who was supposed to pay for the vet bills if my mom took the cat in). Cheap shot, but this cat needed treatment and I absolutely could not do it myself. \\n\\nAt the appointment it is discovered that this cat had FIV which is not transmittable to humans but is to other cats and she must be keep away from other cats. At this point we have our two original cats and the one of my mother's that we are keeping. My mother has three dogs and three cats (one newish kitten that SHE rescued and decided to keep) along with a bunch of rodents. It is already well known that my mom is an animal hoarder. \\n\\nWe discuss who takes the cat and it gets a bit heated. We have a three bedroom house (the one she gave of, free of charge) and a toddler and a baby now on the way. She has a two bedroom house, a barn, a lot of land, and it's just her and her husband. This cat should not be kept around other cats. My mom says she has far too many animals to be able to take her and nowhere to keep her. Currently this cat is in our third room, which we would love to be able to use since we will be needing the extra space. My mom then bought a kitten from petsmart, at which point I flipped out, we had a huge fight, and I asked her why EXACTLY she felt she could get another kitten but not take this cat if she did indeed think she had too many animals. She flat out told me she couldn't answer that. She also says she never remembers saying she would take ANY of the cats back, and she also remembers the dog being part of the original deal- all of which conflicts with what I thought was the original deal.\\n\\nI caved and said fuck it, I'll take the cat but you still have to do all the vet stuff. We have not talked about it since, except for me jokingly saying we would trade GGC for the kitten, who LOVES my daughter.\\n\\nAM I THE ASSHOLE???</td>\n",

If you don't want to know the details, just skip the next part:\\n\\n&amp;gt; Six years ago, I moved into this flat with two roommates and back then, I loved it. We got to know each other quite well, and after a while one of my roomies became my girlfriend. The other roommate moved to a different city but also kept her old room, so she could come over from time to time to visit her old friends. Basically, it was just me and my gf most of the time and I got used to that. I didn't want to share my personal space with anyone else anymore.\\n&amp;gt; \\n&amp;gt; But A few months ago, my gf confessed that she had an affair, I broke up and kicked her out. So then her room was empty and I couldn't afford the rent alone. Finding a new (cheap) place to live is a nightmare in my city. In a few months, I will probably start a new job that will require me to move anyway so I decided it was the best to get a (temporary) roommate.\\n\\nNow, when I was showing the flat to my future roommates, I made it pretty clear that personal space and general quietness are very important to me. My now-roomie said it's the same for him and he doesn't mind. I believed him, so he got the room.\\n\\nHe's a really nice guy and he is absolutely quiet, only invites his gf or 1-2 other friends over, doesn't have any big parties, doesn't listen to loud music, doesn't just burst into my room...\\n\\nBut he likes talking to me. He's from Spain and his German (we're in Germany) is not the best, so he obviously wants to speak German in order to improve. I think that's a really great thing but somehow... after a long day of work, I just want to enjoy my dinner quietly without having to talk to anyone. And I find it really hard to have a relaxed conversation when I can hardly understand him and he can hardly understand me.\\n\\nUsually when I start making dinner, he's coming over after a while, starts making small talk, sometimes preparing his own dinner and sitting down at the table with me.\\n\\nI think that this is pretty normal social behavior so I feel like an ass for trying to avoid him.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey guys, (This is a long post but a good story) \\n\\nSo I'm a 20 year old student from the UK and my girlfriend (19) and I were living in the same building on the university campus. Now my girlfriend and I argue quite a lot and a few months back during an argument she made a personal attack on me and I in turn made a personal attack on her. My girlfriend then turned around and slapped me twice; saying her actions were justified because of what I said. I did not slap her back and simply told her to get out of my room. \\n\\nNow recently we had another argument which was much worse and in this argument I realised where this was going and repeatedly told my girlfriend to leave my room so we could cool down. She refused. \\n\\nEvery single time I tried to make her leave she would scream 'Don't touch me!' Don't touch me!!' \\n\\nSo I went into my bed, under the covers and stopped replying to her in an attempt to cool down, she did not like the fact that I wasn't arguing back with her and thus she in turn poured bottle of water all over my bed covers so that the water seeped through. I then got pissed and tried to snatch the bottle of water away from her to pour it on her and in the process of the struggle she pulled the bottle away really fast and hit her thumb against a wall which turns out ended up breaking her thumb (we didn't know this at the time). \\n\\nAfter this I repeatedly asked her to leave and she refused.\\n\\nI then locked myself in the bathroom and told her I was going to call security; it was at that moment she began to scream saying 'Don't fucking call security!' whilst trying to force open the bathroom door, I didn't want to create drama in my uni halls in front of my room mates (who I didn't really know well) so I held off from calling security (bad decision I know).  \\n\\nOnce it seemed she calmed down I came out the bathroom and the arguing continued. Once again after we verbally insulted each other my girlfriend then slapped me again, at the point I was beginning to lose it but I didn't slap her back. I tried to restrain her and in the process she began trying choke me, I then threw her into the bed to get her away from me.\\n\\nShe got back up and tried to push me again but was unsuccessful. Fast forwarding after more arguing we finally calmed down slightly and there was a silent pause, I then kneeled down to put my charger into a socket and out of no where my girlfriend just pushed me hard and I got knocked into a chair. \\n\\nAt this point. I fucking lose it. \\n\\nI get up, I grab my girlfriend and push her so hard that she goes flying backwards at least 3-4 yards and smashes her back into my door. BANG. \\n\\nAll of sudden she lets off a shriek of pain. Real fucking loud. \\n\\nRemember my neighbors who I mentioned earlier that I don't really know? They hear the screaming and at least 4 guys show up outside my door hearing her screaming 'You pushed me! You pushed me!'. \\n\\nThey in turn say \"Don't worry we're outside, if he's treating you badly we're here and we've already called security!.\" She then tells these guys who are outside my door to get ALL of her friends that live upstairs with her, within 3 minutes I have at least 20 people outside of my door thinking I've just beat my girlfriend up. \\n\\nSecurity arrive and ask me to open the door; I do so and immediately 3 security guards come inside and begin asking what's happened. My girlfriend makes up a story about how she fell despite the fact that she just told the guys outside something entirely different. \\n\\nAs if this couldn't get any worse about 5 minutes later I receive another knock at the door ordering me to open the door. It's the police. \\n\\nOne of the students had called police and upon opening the door these two massive officers walk in. One immediately asks me to leave the room and come outside with him; I do so and as I walk into the corridor I see the looks of all these people I that had once liked me look at me with disgust; no one says anything to me. \\n\\nI'm questioned and let go and according to my girlfriend the police had asked her if she wanted to press charges; she declined.\\n\\nI walked back and I saw everyone from my floor, everyone from her floor, all our mutual friends as well as her close friends from back home who were visiting outside my room once again giving me the most disgusted look thinking I had just beaten her up. \\n\\nNeedless to say I lost all my friends that day and no one cared to even ask me about my side of the story. \\n\\nAt university I now have no friends, and will have to live off campus by myself which means making new friends will be incredibly difficult, it's not helped by the fact that I'm really introverted. I'm also terrified of the prospect of even going out to freshers week as there is only one club at my university and I won't have anyone to go with and anyone that I do bump into from last year will make it really awkward. \\n\\nThis literally keeps me up at night, so tell me, was I an ass hole? \\n\\nEdit* - I've realised that me and my girlfriend can no longer be together.\\n\\nEdit edit* - I just realised PKA is being recorded tonight, perhaps this will be featured on the show.

       "      <td>I started having prostate orgasms earlier this year. Upon hearing this news my wife wanted to see me have one. Because we have what I thought at the time was a healthy sex life, I obliged. She witnessed my quaking orgasm and almost immediately became jealous and slightly hostile. Jealous is the word she used when I asked her what was wrong. She says that she should be the one that gives me the best orgasms not some toy. I don't disagree with this assessment which is why I think she needs to step up her game in the bedroom. Her answer on the other hand is to simply deny me sex if she suspects that I have been masturbating. I think all of this is fucking ridiculous because I just started using sex toys recently while she has been using them for years. She even uses a vibrator for her clitoris while we are actually having sex. I don't mind this at all. I think that any job which is important is a job which requires tools. As far as I'm concerned, sexual health and satisfaction are important and therefore require the use of specialized tools such as dildos, vibrators, porn, whips, etc. I don't think she has any right to try to discourage me from behaving the same way she does.\\n\\nThe only reason why I think I could even possibly be the asshole in this situation is because early in our marriage when I found out she was using sex toys for masturbating I felt some trepidation. She told me that despite the size difference between my penis and her dildos ( I'm smaller ) sex was still great. She also explained to me that she needed to have her clitoris stimulated during intercourse in order to orgasm consistently. I was able to exercise the anxiety I felt about toys over the course of a few months once we started using vibrators during sex.

       "      <td>[disclaimer: The asshole/not an asshole question is mostly about my teacher and partially me. I'm making this because I'm not really that sure if he is one or not, but I will be making this from my point of view]\\n\\nContext: My Theology teacher (male, approx 35) was supposed to go to a doctors appointment, but the sub was unable to fill in, so he probably became pissed that day. I am a male senior in highschool probably pissed him off.\\n\\nIn Theology class, my teacher (I'll call him Mr. Johnson) asked the class who has their homework from his desk. I said that I did, since I was close to him, I decided to try to hand it to him. Unfortunately, the distance between me and him was about a yard, so I tossed it onto his desk. He caught it and then ripped the paper and saying, \"You don't throw things to me.\" in a stern voice and then threw the shreds in the recycling bin.\\n\\nI decided that I would pick up what's left of my homework after class. About 5 minutes after Mr. Johnson ripped up my homework, another teacher (I'll call her Ms. Robertson) came into class asking for the recycling bin, so I was unable to take back my homework, tape it back together, and attempt to try to return it in. Because Ms. Robertson \"just happened\" to come into the class asking for the recycling bin, I'm very positive that Mr. Johnson did this, since he already knew that Ms. Robertson will come in for the bin.\\n\\nLater on in class, one of my classmates (I'll call him Sean) turned around and told me that two years ago, Mr. Johnson burned his notes in class. It turns out that, at the time, Mr. Johnson told Sean to not take notes, so Mr. Johnson put Sean's notes into a bowl and lit them on fire. After hearing this, Mr. Johnson's behavior is not that abnormal to my situation.\\n\\nCoincidentally, the topic of Plato's interpretation of 'what is evil?' came. Accoriding to Plato, there is not such thing as not good and that evil is just not accepting good. In a way, Mr. Johnson tearing my paper can be seen as him teaching me a lesson on respect/his untold class rules. After school, I asked him if I could make up the homework. He said not to worry about it and that he will accept it. Basically, this entire situation was an extremely harsh 'slap on the wrist' scare tactic punishment from my teacher.\\n\\nSo, what I'm trying to ask is, is Mr. Johnson an asshole for over reacting, or do I deserve what happened because of my disrepect?\\n\\nTL;DR: Teacher, probably pissed because sub no-showed, ripped up my homework because I tossed it to him when he was a couple of inches away. He saw that as disrepect, and decided to teach me a lesson about respect, but he ended up taking the homework in the end.</td>\n",

       "      <td>So my ex-best friend Katie hasn't talked to me ever since I started dating her ex Matt 5 months ago. A little history first:\\n\\n - I've known Katie since 6th grade and we are both 22 now. We've had the same group of friends ever since we met and have continued to be in the same small group of friends up until this all happened. Katie started acting weird ever since we finished our undergrad. I mean weird as in she had been more anti-social, more critical of strangers, and just generally less pleasant to be around. I talked about it with a couple of my other friends in our group and they agreed that she'd been acting weird ever since she didn't get her dream job coming out of school.\\n\\n - Matt and I met my sophomore year of high school and he and I instantly became good friends. He was a year younger than I and I was already in a relationship (that lasted until I was 20), so I never thought of him as more than a good friend. He would listen to me if I was having trouble with my boyfriend and I would listen to him bitch about whatever problems he was having. We would go a month or two without contact sometimes, but would pick up wherever we left off once we ran into each other again.\\n\\n - Well around the time I broke up with my boyfriend, Matt and Katie started dating. I thought it was the best thing in the world because two of my good friends were dating. Well I was wrong. They were together for a little over a year and in that time they fought for at least half of it. Katie was downright mean to Matt. She told him his friends were always annoying, that she didn't really like his parents, that his hobbies (mostly playing his instruments) were dumb, etc. In hindsight, I should have sad something. But when either would bitch to me about how the other had done something stupid, I insisted that I was to stay neutral because it wouldn't be fair to either of them if I took a side. They both respected my decision.\\n\\nSo Matt and Katie broke up back in December of 2014, but kept in contact until the end of March this year. I saw Matt, without Katie being with him, for the first time in about 6 months in mid-April of this year and we chatted for a little bit. He told me how much happier he was without Katie and I just said I was glad he was happy.\\nThen we started talking more and more throughout the month. It was the first time we had been friends without one of us in a relationship so we were beginning to talk like never before. And by the end of May this year we had started dating.\\n\\nWhile all that was happening, I was thinking about how Katie would react. I knew it may not be right, but it had been 5 months since they broke up and she was a major bitch to him half the relationship. So I told her a week before we started dating and she was infuriated. All she told me was that it wasn't okay and that she didn't approve at all. She has avoided seeing me at all costs and it has put some tension in our group of friends. She refuses to discuss it with anyone as well.\\n\\nMy logic is that they broke up 5 months before we started dating and she was a jerk to him for so long. Her logic, I'm assuming, is that I betrayed her. So Reddit, am I the asshole?</td>\n",

I'm hating every minute and gently encouraged him to finish a song and then play that for me, rather than practice around me because some of what he's doing just sounds awful and some sounds really great. I go to a college with a lot of music theatre majors who tend to go around singing in the hallways, which the rest of us at school find profoundly annoying. Sometimes my boyfriend can be really dense, and I'll tell him something and he just won't listen. I've had to explain to him what my major is at school about five times before he finally knew what I was talking about. \\n\\nAnyway, after he didn't listen to my requests for him to wait to finish a song to play this around me, I decided to be more clear, however I was also kind of mean. I said \"Fucking musicians don't care that nobody wants to hear them practice.\" And explained that I'm subjected to practicing musicians daily and don't want to be subjected to this at home. I was already annoyed at him when I said this because he had taken me to the dentist in my car and didn't have a ride back home. He wanted me to drive him home, and I said \"What was the point of you driving me today? It was to not have to drive today. I'll get you a cab, but I'm really disappointed you did not think this through.\" He thinks it's not a big deal because he got me where I needed to be and figured he would figure the rest out as he went along, but that kind of thing makes me wonder if he's even a reliable enough person to be my boyfriend. I know he doesn't do a very good job planning ahead for anything. I feel like I should have asked a friend for a ride, I have friends who are so much more reliable than he is. \\n\\nSo today he texts me that I need to be more sensitive to him about his music. I really offended him with the 'fucking musicians' comment. I feel like I'm being generous by calling him a musician, when all he's doing with music is playing with a new app on his phone and he gave up on bass guitar years ago. We've been together since May and if he had thought he was a DJ in May I wouldn't have started dating him. I have always hated the guy at the party who thinks he's a DJ and has no real skills. He knows already that I don't like what I call 'song ADD' wherein a person doesn't play an entire song and keeps skipping and that's basically what he's doing with this app. I've also said \"Remixing a song is like admitting you were wrong\" or \"Why would they remix this song, it's perfect in it's original form\" and other such things, so he does already know that I don't like this sort of thing.\\n\\nSo which one of us is the bigger asshole right now? I know I'm asshole for using harsh language and knocking his passion, but I also think if he's so passionate about making music, why didn't he do anything like this before he got a new phone? \\n\\nTL;DR Boyfriend thinks he's a DJ on his iPhone and I said musicians suck for thinking everyone wants to hear them practice.</td>\n",

       "      <td>So me and my girlfriend started dating in high school about 4 months before graduating. Everything was going great until the end of summer when she moved 4 hours away for school. We mutually decided that we should go for it, because she initially said that she would return to our current city to go to a university here after this year of university ends.\\n\\nHowever, just by what she tells me, she is very enveloped in the school in regards to clubs, activities, professional connections, and a LOT of friends. And because of all this, she never talks to me unless I initiate conversation over text. I don't know if this is a common thing among girls to just never talk to the guy first, but it's pretty ridiculous that I ALWAYS have to start conversation if we are going to actually talk.\\n\\nAnyways, I don't want to have to wait 4 fucking years for her to finish school just to see if this miraculously works out. Even then, she could just decide that I'm not worth keeping around and completely remove me from her life before then.\\n\\nI know it was kinda stupid getting into a relationship at that stage of my life, but knowing me, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself knowing I never at least gave it a shot.\\n\\nSo, am I that asshole for thinking it would benefit us both to end this emotionally draining relationship that I'm not enjoying?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I work retail for a small company, nothing you would have heard of. I've worked for the company for about five months, and in that time, my location's sales have skyrocketed. I've been promoted to manager (a promotion in title only, i don't really do much authoritative stuff), and I've been offered additional promotions. I've turned them down due to other circumstances (namely a lack of transportation), but all of this is to illustrate that my boss has good reason to like me and keep me happy as an employee.\\n\\nLast week, he showed up at my location on a day when i wasn't working and dropped off an ipad for \"me/the store.\" As far as i can tell, it's for me, and I'm welcome to use it for research at the store, but it's really mine. He said it was a gift because i was doing so well with sales, and to help encourage me to keep it up. Not unheard of, and i was thrilled to hear about it.\\n\\nI dropped by the store to pick it up, and my excitement...faltered. it's an old ipad 2, which is swiftly becoming outdated/obsolete. It's refurbished, which i don't really have a problem with, but...it's broken. There's a massive dent in one corner which prevents the glass from sitting properly in the frame, so dust gets underneath the screen and generally fucks things up. The home button also doesn't work. Fortunately, i know how to fix all of these things, and i have the resources to do so. I'm just a little miffed that he gifted me a broken device. I don't know if he *knew* it was broken and knew I could fix it, or if he just didn't check it out before he gave it to me.\\n\\n**in summary**\\n\\nMy boss gave me a broken ipad as a \"you're awesome, keep it up\" present.\\n\\n**boss points:** he didn't have to give me this ipad, he did it out of generosity. He may not have known it was broken, or he may have trusted me to fix it myself. He may also have gotten the best he could afford - I'm not important enough in the company to know how much extra money there is to throw around.\\n\\n**my points:** it's *broken.* if this gift is a reflection of his opinion of me, I'm honestly insulted. It's an old device, bordering on useless, and it's broken. If you really cared, wouldn't you get me something nice that reflected it?\\n\\nI feel like an asshole for being upset, but my husband thinks I'm justified in being insulted. I'm not going to give it back or do anything like that...looking a gift horse in the mouth and whatnot. I'm going to suck it up, fix what's broken, and use it if i can. I'm just wondering if I'm right for being miffed.</td>\n",

I've known Drew for a little over a year and we're pretty good friends. Last week he found out I have a premium Spotify account and immediately asked for the account info so he could use it. \\n\\nI denied him this because:\\n\\n* I don't feel comfortable sharing passwords and account info with anyone, no matter how much I trust them. I don't know if they'll share it with anyone past that and I have potentially sensitive information on there\\n\\n* It doesn't feel right to me that I work to pay for it and he would get it for free\\n\\n* I don't want him fucking with my playlists (selfish but ya know)\\n\\n* I don't want him deleting/locking me out of my account somehow\\n\\n(Again I trust this person to some degree but those are still my reasons.)\\n\\nI explained these points to him and he got pissed at me for not letting him have it. I called on our friend Evan as a third party and Evan agreed with my reasons and respected them but also sided with Drew slightly saying that it was a dick move to not let him use it. In my opinion he's not neutral because he mostly sides with Drew on this (and other things)\\n\\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for not letting a guy use my Spotify premium account for the above reasons?

                 I love the musical *Les Miserables*. A coworker of mine said that they didn't like it. I asked why and they said, among other things, that \"it's not a musical, it's an opera.\"\\n\\nNow, I happen to be an opera singer. I told them adamantly that it is NOT an opera. There are a number of things that make this true, but if you can take my word for it- and I hope you can- it's not a matter of opinion whether a mainstream musical is an opera or not. It is a musical, period.\\n\\nMy coworker thought otherwise. \"My boyfriend writes musicals and he agrees with me\" was the extent of her argument. Well, he may well write musicals but that doesn't mean he knows anything about opera. You might as well ask a jazz pianist to tell you about Beethoven- it's not the same area of expertise even if it's related. I told her \"You're entitled to your opinion even if it's wrong\" in a sort-of joking way. Maybe I was being dickish.\\n\\nI gotta know- am I the asshole?   \n",

                                                       I work out of town so I'm usually home only 3 maybe 4 nights a week. Last week I spent Tuesday through Friday out of town and got home at about 8 pm Friday. Saturday my girlfriend had a meeting at 11 Am and it was supposed to be a couple hours, she went out with a coworker till about 11 pm when I picked her up and drove her home. I knew where she was, and I knew who she was with, I was a bit frustrated that I never got an invite, and I was annoyed that so much of our finite amount of time that we're home together was wasted. Instead of saying \"hey how bout you come home\" I just waiting thinking she'd show up at some point. We got in an argument about it then I went to bed. I feel like I am the asshole.    \n",

and I are seniors in high school and he starts to date this girl who is the worst. She treats him like shit and a bitch while he continues to tell us that he's in love and that they are perfect for each other. She is also a Debbie Downer and will never mind her own business which causes me and many of our mutual friends to dislike her a lot, however despite that fact I decided to be friendly towards her in order to keep my friend happy and her not so much of a problem. \\n\\nCut to a month or two ago when he is begging a bunch of our friends to let her come to a music festival with us because he promised her he would go with her without getting a place to stay. We do not like this idea at all but he just will not back down. He is so persistent about it that I finally snap and tell him that the reason she cannot come with is is because I hate her. Well this makes him riled up so he goes and tells his girlfriend the entire story. After that she would refuse to talk to me and wouldn't hang out with our group when I'm around, and wherever she goes he goes. \\n\\nCut to today where tells me it isn't fair she cannot hang out with our group, but my girlfriend is (she is very well liked by my friends.) We get to talking and he tells me to apologize to his girlfriend for making her feel bad because I \"pretended to be her friend,\" and I refused. Am I the asshole?   \n",

A lot of it comes down to us being from different cultures, but most of my well-intended mistakes have been interpreted as offensive. I do get along with my aunt &amp; uncle-in-law and they've attempted to stick up for me to my in-laws.\\n\\nMy cousin-in-law is getting married in a few weeks. I get along with her but I'm not close to her. I've been dreading the wedding because interactions with my in-laws are always very stressful.\\n\\nA month ago, my mom was diagnosed with extremely aggressive breast cancer. She's stage 4 with type 4 lymphoma. While the doctors have a lot of optimism, there's a very real chance it could be fatal. The doctors are rushing her into treatment before the cancer metastasizes. Her second chemo treatment, the \"bad one\" as the doctors call it, is the same day as my cousin-in-law's wedding.\\n\\nMy mom lives 400 miles away; my cousin-in-law is local.\\n\\nMy mom is terrified of the chemo. I planned on being there for all her chemo treatments since I telecommute and my boss has told me to be wherever I need to be in order to take care of my mom.\\n\\nLast night, my wife asked me what suit I plan on wearing to her cousin's wedding. I told her I'm not going because the wedding is the same weekend as one of my mom's chemo treatments and I need to be there for my mom. My wife told me she didn't use an excuse out of my cousin's wedding.\\n\\n[AITA] #1: I angrily replied my wife was being unfair because no one in her family was dying of cancer when my cousin was getting married.\\n\\n[AITA] #2: My wife replied my mom isn't dying, just very ill, so it would be selfish of me to take care of her. I told my wife she was being an asshole and walked away.\\n\\nI'm struggling with the ethics on this one. I believe taking care of sick family always comes first no matter whose side of the family is sick. Is that a wrong thing to believe?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      So this happened a while ago actually, but I've always wanted to know, from an objective viewpoint... Am I the asshole or were they?\\n\\nOk, so, I've lived with the same five people for three years now. In the second year, I and one of the guys I was living with got together. Let's call him John. So me and John got together in the second year of us all being together, that was all great.\\n\\nCome September, all five of us move out of that house and into another. However, this house has slightly smaller bedrooms, and out of five, only two have double beds.\\n\\nThis is where I begin to wonder who is being the asshole. One of our housemates took one of the three single rooms, fair play. But the other two, (both single, don't ever bring anyone back on a night out, basically only ever sleep alone in their beds) decide they want the double rooms.\\n\\nThis pissed me off a bit because, if I was living with a couple and there were limited single beds, it wouldn't even be a question for me- one of them should have a double bed. Because they naturally will share a bed every night. What couple wants to go to seperate single beds every night?\\n\\nSo long story short-ish, we ended up drawing names out of a hat, and lo and behold, the two single people get the double bedrooms. I hoped someone would be big enough to offer me or John one, but no.\\n\\nSo me and John now share one tiny bedroom which we ended up putting two mattresses on the floor and sleeping on that.\\n\\nSo, sorry it's so long but... Am I the asshole for thinking myself or John should have gotten a double bedroom, or are they for being selfish?\\n\\n**tldr: housemates took the only two double bedrooms in the house even though they're single leaving me and my boyfriend to have two tiny single bedrooms.**\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nedit: Just to clarify, when I say double bedorom I mean a bedroom with a double bed in it. Not like, a bunk room or something.   \n",

                                 The driver stopped, rolled down her window and apologized, saying \"I'm so sorry. I didn't even see you.\" I responded by pointing out that the reason she hadn't seen us was because she didn't look.  I was calm, didn't yell or anything. My wife asserts that I was being an asshole for telling the driver she didn't look. Is she right?   \n",

I just heard this community exists and I thought it would be the perfect place to talk about this. I posted the whole story in /r/pettyrevenge and got a really mixed bag of responses, so I'm curious what people here think.\\n\\nBasically, I was at a John Mayer concert, in a pretty good seat but off to the side (not in the pit, which is relevant). When JM came out, he was playing a really rockin' tune, so I stood up and started jamming out. I would say ~90% of the people in the arena were standing for this, but my section was a disproportionately sitting one. I was really the only one in the immediate area standing. I would stand and sit intermittently as the songs went on based on the dance-factor of the song and how much I liked it.\\n\\nAt one point while I was standing up, two women about four rows behind me started throwing popcorn at me and yelling at me to sit down. I got really embarrassed and sat, but after a few minutes I was upset with how they had handled it, so a few songs later, I stood back up (with the help of my girlfriend and a few other people around us who had scene the exchange). By this point a few other isolated people/couples had done the same for a couple songs at a time. My \"petty revenge\" was subtly encouraging people around me to stand up, helping create a majority so that a.) it would be fine for me to stand and b.) the women would have a harder time telling 20 people to sit down.\\n\\nTo be fair, I was a lot meaner in the telling in /r/pettyrevenge, so [here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y9dny/standing_up_for_my_right_to_stand_up/) if you'd like to read it and the ensuing comments. I just kind of assumed people would be on my side, as you can tell by my whiny edit at the top. \\n\\nAm I the asshole? I want to believe I'm not, mostly because I think throwing popcorn at someone is incredibly rude, at which point I didn't care, and I would have responded much more sympathetically to a more gentle approach. Other people felt that I was not entitled to any courtesies because I started the asshole train by standing in the first place, and honestly I understand that too, which is why I sat down in the first place. I didn't want to be rude and block views. But I also believed that I wasn't in the wrong to stand given the nature of the act--he's got some jams and is very encouraging of light dancing. Still, for people that just wanted to sit down and enjoy the show, I was definitely hurting the experience. Please let me know what you think.\\n\\n**tl;dr** Stood up at a concert, got popcorn'd, stood back up later, encouraging others to do the same.   \n",

                                                                  Ok like I stated in the title I think I'm being an asshole. But there's this part of me that's perhaps irrationally pissed off at my boyfriend for this reason. \\n\\nI'm a 21 year old female and I'd been out with my boyfriend and a couple of his mates. We'd been at a bar and I have an 8am shift in the morning so I had to go to bed. My boyfriend however wanted to go pick up some booze and go to his mates for some more drinks - absolutely fine by me. \\n\\nSo I call a taxi to take me home and he asks me if I want him to stay with me. I say no its absolutely fine go get booze with your mates. He offered a  couple of times and I said I'm absolutely fine just go. So he did. \\n\\nThen as I was stood alone in the street waiting for my taxi I realised I actually thought it was really shitty of him to leave me like that. And I know, I fucking SAID it was fine. I did. And that's why I think I'm the asshole. But.... A part of me just got annoyed he would actually leave me like that alone at night on the street. \\n\\nSo yeah I know I said it was fine, and this is the thing - I meant it at the time. I really did. I'm not one of those girls who plays mind games with guys (or at least I didn't think I was) and so when I said it it wasn't meant as some sort of fucking test.. I did mean it. But upon thinking about it I just feel like he should know it's not cool to leave a girl on her own at night like that? \\n\\nI text him about it but I feel like a dick. Does anyone want to confirm that for me?\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

                                     I'm foreign (Honduran) and my girlfriend is American. She comes from a rough background (both parents passed away). She was then taken in by a family friend (semi mother in law). We are moving away together. My parents have helped my girlfriend by letting her live rent free in my apartment to save up, etc. They will also give her a head start rent free when we move. Semi mother in law, whom Ive met twice and never given her a reason to distrust me, told her that I was probably only into the relationship for a green card and that my parents were only helping her for that reason. None of this is true. I love my girlfriend deeply and my parents are good, generous people who want to help her because I love her and because they know she's had it rough. Semi mother in law knows nothing about our relationship and she has been known to be a bit of a racist. I really wanna say something, albeit respectfully, about how I found it very offensive that she would make these assumptions knowing nothing about me, my parents or our relationship. My girlfriend got pissed at me for this. Am I the asshole for wanting to stop a racist?   \n",

 Me my gf and my brother's fiance have been hand rearing kittens since the mother died when the kittens were 2 weeks old. They are now 8 weeks old. My brother's fiance's mom was told to come and feed the kittens at 10 before she was going to work.I'd feed them the other times during the day as they need to be fed every three hours.  Keep in mind, these aren't my kittens the mother was not my cat. I plan on keeping one of the kittens other then that it shouldn't be my problem. I've been feeding and bathing them while they are at work.\\n\\nMonday me and my gf walk in on this http://imgur.com/a/VASih and spent 3 hours between going to walmart and buying them two smaller litter boxes so they'd be easier to clean. Cleaning supplies to sanitize the area. Cat food for them because they have diarrhea and I thought reverting back to the old brand would be better for them. Bathed them cleaned everything. It took 3 hours to do, three hours in the middle of the day when I wanted to do other things. I've also bought a majority of their food. Watched them over a long weekend while they were at the coast. Took them to the vet for them. \\n\\nMy gf went to work, my brother came home. Told him that me and my gf were pissed, her especially about how bad things were. He asked if he should apologize. I said yeah. Then he started getting pissed and defensive saying he shouldn't appologize to my girlfriend for the way HE raises HIS cats. I say, well you should appologize to her because we spent three hours today cleaning up shit, litterally, that wasn't our fucking mess. He said \"well you chose to do that, you didn't have to.\" I told him, no conscionable human being would leave animals in that condition a second longer. He said \"look, they have diarhea and they shit and they leave paw prints of shit places. We clean it daily.\" Told him \"If I walked in on that at someone else's house, I'd of called the cops.\" He said he's not going to appologize. \\n\\nYesterday his fiance was slamming doors that morning at 7am. I left to do stuff came back at 7pm. Went straight to the kitties room. It was clean but they forgot to fill up their water bowl. Went to my room didn't talk to them.\\n\\nWednesday, (today) his fiance comes in. My gf is here today, wasn't yesterday. Says we have no right to call her neglectful that they clean their room daily. That she woke up and there was a couple shits in the shower but that she had to work and she'd figure we'd clean it when we woke up and that she is not going to appologize. The future sister in law was raising her voice and didn't let my gf speak more then a couple words and had a look of crazy on her face. Are me and the gf really over reacting to the situation or is it as fucked up as I think it is. \\n\\nI also want to point out that other then this instance the kittens have been well taken care of. They told me that they cleaned their room the day before, I don't believe them. I bathe them regularly, they don't give a shit, and I feed and water them regularly. \\n\\n**tldr: do you consider this abuse? http://imgur.com/a/VASih or am I an asshole for calling my brother and his fiance neglectful and expecting an apology?**   \n",

mom called her and began to cuss her out for all the wrong reasons. She asked me to not talk to my mother about my problems because she was afraid of it happening again. A few days ago I got into a fight with my girlfriend because I looked at her text messages without her permission (she allows me to do so if I ask her to). Naturally, she was very offended by what I did and an argument followed. This has been one of the worst arguments we have ever had, with her giving me an ultimatum to either clean up my act or have her leave. I, confused and upset with myself about this whole mess, decided to talk with my mother about my problem. In my girlfriend's and her friends' eyes, I am a jerk who manipulates her and causes problems. To my mother, my girlfriend is the one who causes the problems and manipulates me. Today, I resolved my issue with my girlfriend by promising her to not be as paranoid as I have been before. Only now, she refuses to come over because she feels like my mother hates her, and she claims that I have started another major problem in our relationship, although my mother only claimed that she disliked the way my girlfriend treated me during our argument. Am I the asshole for talking to my mother about my problems?\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for the feedback everyone. I have left out some information when I posted this, so please bear with me. I had the fight with my girlfriend the night before I went on a 3 day road trip with my family. When I was texting my girlfriend during my trip, she was treating me very coldly and bitterly, which is understandable. Although she was very upset with me and gave me a one month warning to clean up my act, she acted as if she doubted my ability to make things better with her. This made me very upset throughout my whole vacation, which is the reason my mother is upset with her. In addition, during my vacation (where I had little to no reception, so talking to her was almost out of the question) she decides to inform me that she was going to hang out with my best friend, a male, for one day that I was gone. She told me not to worry about it. To show her that I'm making a major attempt to not be jealous and possessive (as the best friend she was to hang out with had rudely pointed out to me a day prior), I told her I was not worried about it. After my vacation I tried to ask her if she was glad that I was making improvement. Instead, she once again treated me coldly, claiming that I shouldn't have been worried in the first place. This also upsetted my mother as my girlfriend had left out the fact that she needed help getting around (as she was home alone for the day), which in turn made her claim to hang out with my best friend seem as if she was trying to spite me for being jealous/possesive.   \n",

                                                                                                            I invited my friend to go in a weekend camping trip, along with her son. I was accompanied by my child, and my husband joined us the next day. It was a three hour drive to the campsite, so we stopped along the way to have dinner at my in laws, who live nearby. My friend and her son didn't like the dinner (spaghetti), so I ran to the store to get him mac and cheese. At that time, I asked if she wanted to go with me, since she had told me she needed groceries. She hemmed and hawed and finally said no, we can go later. So, we eat dinner, and then decide to leave asap, since it will be getting dark in a few hours and we wanted to get set up in daylight. At this point I made my fatal error. I forgot to go to the grocery store. Along the way, my friend mentions this...but at this point we are no longer near a grocery store, so I stop at Sheetz, which is a large gas/convenience store. She gets her stuff, we go to the campsite and set up. For the entire weekend she proceeds to complain about not having food, even though my husband stopped at the store and got her food that she requested, as well as the fact that the campout we went to had plenty of food, there was a potluck breakfast, and I went searching for food that she wanted and found it. Still not enough. Might I mention that her son didn't give a crap about the food,  he was only stressed because she was making him stressed, imo.. we didn't speak for a week afterwards, and when we did hang out, she proceeds to tell me how I fucked up her weekend.  I cry, then leave.\\n\\nTl;dr I forgot to take my friend to the store, she proceeds to ruin my trip, says its all my fault.\\n\\nEdit: I had packed lots of food, which she also refused to eat...but she drank our beer and left half bottles of it everywhere. I didn't ask her for any gas money, or money for the campout. She did buy the weed though.   \n",

The first year, I was a senior in college and he had graduated a year earlier and co-founded a startup. Of the guys I'd dated, he was the most put-together, the most reliable, the most attractive, the LEAST argumentative (we never ever fought), and I felt had the most potential. At the end of the day though, I felt as if he didn't \"get me\" like my other partners had, but as it was his first real relationship I decided not to give up on this great guy.\\n\\nUpon graduation, I was offered a job 900 miles away. Rex had his company back home and couldn't leave. I wanted to break it off right then and save myself the pain, but he and his sweet words convinced me we could make it work. Neither of us believes in soulmates so we thought if we put in the work we could make it happen. I moved, he stayed, and our long-distance relationship began.\\n\\nAnd by LDR, I mean my chronic loneliness. I am not an outgoing person, I didn't know a single person in the whole state, I walked into my empty apartment crying almost every day, and I clung to Rex for comfort. We alternate turns to take a flight and got to see each other maybe every other month. He truly tried to be there for me, but those happy weekends when he came down would only make me sadder when he left again. He said what he could but I knew my depression was wearing on him and us. At one point he told me just to stop talking about sad things. I knew I had to turn things around, and luckily I was at a company full of young transplants like me, so I began forcing myself to go out on weekends. I flourished. I made friends, got to know the new city, and was finally smiling again. The problem with this new life was that Rex wasn't a part of it. He didn't know the people I talked about and couldn't relate to the culture I was now a part of. I live in an awesome place, and when I would tell him about the fun times I was having I felt like I was rubbing it in his face. I felt completely torn; like I had to choose between a life of sadness with Rex and a life of happiness without him.\\n\\nFF to this JanuaryโI was laid off from my amazing job. I got a freelance gig to pay rent while I found a new job while all those friends I made moved away. By this time things were worse with Rex. Not that we were dysfunctional, but instead of growing closer as two people are supposed to do over time, we grew further and further apart. I felt single 99% of the time. When he would visit, I would get annoyed at another person being in my space and it took me a while to warm up to him physically again. I couldn't see marriage in our future (truth is I think I'm too young to see marriage at all), and I wanted to break it off what was left of our relationship because we were both pouring so much emotion, effort, and money into this thing. I wanted to do it in person of course and the next opportunity was February. My parents were supposed to be visiting before he got here, but their flights got messed up and my mother, father, and Rex all ended up staying with me that weekend. How could I break up with him in that situation? I decided to wait until the next opportunity.\\n\\nBefore that opportunity came, Rex's cofounders kicked him out of his own company. It was a terrible situation, his world was crashing down, and I still considered him my best friend so I just didn't have the heart to break up with him in a time like that. We always said when we were free, we'd be together again. I wanted to stay here and he didn't want to go home or stay in a college town so naturally he wanted to move here for me. Even though he was hurting from his situation I knew I could not let him do that. How could I let him move his whole life for someone who wasn't nearly on the same page relationship-wise? I also knew that since I had lost all my friends, we would cling to each other and not go out and meet new people. I flew back home, and I ended it. I felt awful, and of course he accused me of only dating him \"for his company.\"\\nNot even two weeks later, Rex's best childhood friend committed suicide. I found out on social media and broke down crying at work. I immediately called him and left a message just to know if he needed to talk he could. This great guy had just been betrayed by his company, his girlfriend, and his friend. We went through a couple weeks of txting/calling, that would go from friendly to \"fuck you\" in a second. He left it at \"I'll reach out when I'm ready to talk to you again\" and I left him alone.\\n\\nI had told Rex that I wanted to be single for a while because I hadn't been single longer than 3 months since I was 16. But life is funny sometimes, and I unexpectedly found a new guy who I just CLICKED with immediately. He thought I was funny, he loved to dance, we could talk forever, and it made me wonder why I'd spent so many silent, danceless nights with Rex. Like I said, I had felt single and alone for so long. But it was only about a month after the breakup so initially I tried to hide it from social media to not hurt my ex. However, he started posting pictures of his new girl and I assumed all was well again.\\n\\nOne of the last things Rex said to me was to let him know if my address ever changed. I'm going through a move to a new apartment now and texted him to let him know. He texts me back to let me know he's in bed with his new girl talking to her about how terrible I am and how neither of them can fathom \"what kind of person\" would have done what I did. He said I was mean during his hard times, even though I tried to be there for him as much as I knew how. He couldn't believe I was dating someone, even though he was doing the exact same thing. The text ended with \"I could give a shit about anyone like you anymore.\"\\n\\nI know I should just move on and not care, but I am so hurt. I'm the type of person that can't deal with anyone being upset with me, it just kills me to the core. Just because I didn't want to be with him romantically anymore doesn't mean I stopped caring about him as a person. The timing in this whole thing was the worst it could have possibly been.\\n\\nWas I in the wrong? Should I have let him move his life to a new city to support him in his time of need, knowing that I didn't want to be with him? What could I have done differently? Does he truly hate me, or was that just an emotional response? AM I an asshole?\\n\\nI know this was long, but thanks for caring &lt;3   \n",
       "158   Throwaway account because some family members know my main account name on here.  The details in the post should be enough to identify me if they stumble upon this post, but my sister has, in the past, looked up my post history and used it against me.  Anyway,\\n\\n**Back story**\\n\\nIn 2009, my fiancee and I were renting an apartment when my grandmother went into a rehabilitation facility after a fall.  My family was pretty sure she wouldn't be coming back home, and they asked my fiancee and I to move in.  They told us at this time that we would be renting from them under the terms that:\\n\\n- They would charge us a rental fee equal to the mortgage amount, no more and no less (so we were basically paying the mortgage but the house wasn't in our name and we can't claim it on our taxes)\\n\\n- When we were ready to buy, they would sell the house to us at [Market Value - 10% - {however much money we had paid in rent so far}]\\n\\n- If something ever happened to them, they would leave the house to us in their will.\\n\\nIn 2011, we got married (yay!) and we were going to start saving up to buy the house.  They told us at this point that they realized they couldn't fulfill the terms of the \"MV-10%-paid\" plan they previously suggested, that they would lose too much money.  We would just have to pay market value. ($130k)  We asked the price, they told us, and we balked.  We said it was out of our price range ($80-100k) and we would be looking around.\\n\\nWe contacted a realtor, got preapproved, we were going through a first time homebuyer class that, if completed, would pay our down payment and closing costs (up to $5000) on the house.\\n\\nOnce my mom found out, she got really worried.  She said she wanted us to stay in this house.\\n\\nA point relevant to the story that is important and complicates matters that I had neglected to mention to this point is that our house is next door to their house.  We share a yard (and we're not really outdoor people so their use of our yard is like 95% to 5% compared to our own), they have two sheds in our yard for storage, my father keeps a bunch of stuff in our basement and my mother keeps a bunch of stuff in our attic, so clearly they have an interest in not wanting us to move beyond just \"I want my kid next door to me\"  Anyway, moving on...\\n\\nWe reminded them that we could not afford the house at the price they were asking and were going to have to look elsewhere.  Eventually, my mom told us to stop looking for houses; that they would do \"whatever it takes to get you this house.\"\\n\\nThe deal they were offering was: They would sell the house to us at $130,000, with a $30,000 gift of equity.  That GoE would be our down payment on the house, which would allow us to avoid PMI and would put our loan amount at $100,000 (which was within our price range).  We accepted.\\n\\nGoing through the homebuying process, our lender had a house appraiser come out and appraise it.  The house appraised for 120k (10k less than what their appraiser said).  They weren't happy but still agreed to go through with the deal rather than have us look elsewhere.\\n\\nIn April of 2014, we became homeowners.  Everything was going fine, until...\\n\\n**Recent events**\\n\\nEarly last month I came out to my mom as transgender.  I've felt this way for a while but had been scared to tell her.  I was afraid they might kick us out of the house if they knew, which was why we wanted to move first.  We accepted the deal on this house because it was a good deal; we wouldn't have accepted it otherwise.\\n\\nMy mom has been taking it rough.  When I first told her, she seemed fine, but she later said that she was in shock.  Eventually she asked me if I knew [that I was transgender] before they sold us the house.  I said yes.  She accused me of deceiving them and screwing them and ripping them off.  I asked, \"If I had told you when we were renting, would you have kicked us out?\"  She said yes.\\n\\nShe later rescinded that \"yes\", said she didn't mean it; she was angry.  She apologized, but still insisted upon how we tricked/screwed/deceived her.  I asked \"Would you have sold me the house if I had told you before you did?\"  She said no.\\n\\nTo this point, we hadn't told my dad, yet.  Whenever I brought it up, she shot it down, saying he should \"go to his grave without ever finding out about this\" and other such things.  Meanwhile, she was smoking heavily, drinking heavily, and she repeatedly dropped hints that she might be doing pot or acid but I don't know if they were true or bluffing.\\n\\n**Last week and Sunday**\\n\\nLast week, she said she wanted everyone to sit down together and we were going to tell my dad.  That was scheduled for the Sunday that just passed (7/20).  At the table were my mom and dad, my dad's pastor, my sister and her husband, me and my wife, my mother in law and her son (my wife's brother).\\n\\nI told him, to which he admitted that he knew, he had known for a month (My mom told him) and the pastor had been counseling him for the past month.\\n\\nHe immediately dove in to the matter of the house, that they felt deceived, and that I needed to \"make it right\".  I told him \"When we're ready to move, I will sell you the house back.\"  \"At the same deal we gave you?\" \"Yes\"\\n\\nHe says \"Good.  That makes me feel better.  That's water under the bridge.\" and we begin talking about me for a bit...\\n\\nEventually though, it comes back to the house.  He insists that we must sell it back to them before 12/1 of this year, otherwise they will have to pay capitol gains tax on the money they made on the house if they do not reinvest it, and they will need that money to afford to buy the house back.  He says we can go back to renting from them, under the condition that \"you don't escalate the situation or try to throw it in our face.\"\\n\\nWhen pressed for details, he was basically saying that he doesn't want to see me \"dressed like that\" or \"acting like that.\"  I pointed out that I've been going out in public like this for the past three years and they haven't noticed.  The pastor chimes in by asking my father \"What if you do run into him by accident, then what?\" (still using a male pronoun for me)  My father says \"I can let it go, ONCE.\"  I ask \"So what happens after once, then what?\"  And he just sort of deflects.  I asked for examples of \"rubbing it in his face\" that I wouldn't be allowed to do, he doesn't want to see \"any rainbow stickers on your car\" and was a huge stickler about when I said \"sometimes I take the trash out at night in a skirt, but you're usually in bed that late\" to which he keeps pushing that I need to get changed if I do this, just in case he comes outside and sees me.\\n\\nI tell them I can't agree to these terms, and there's a dispute where they insult me for 'changing my mind' (paraphrase) when I make it clear that I said I'd sell it back *when we were ready to move* and that I could not possibly come up with enough money to buy a house by December (even, and I'm being extremely generous, if I could come up with $500 a month in savings, every month, for five months, that's still barely half of a down payment) short of winning the lottery.  I tell them we could be ready to move in 2-3 years, this is unacceptable to them, they're pushing that December 1st deadline on me, HARD.\\n\\n**Events over this week**\\n\\nMy mother called me on Monday to try to persuade me to change my mind and I declined.  She called my wife and talked to her as well but didn't get anywhere.\\n\\nShe called me again on Tuesday to try to persuade me again with no luck.  She says to me \"Your wife came to me in tears and sat there on my couch and PROMISED me you would make it right.  Are you going to honor your wife's promise or not?\"  I tell her I will need to talk to my wife.\\n\\nMy wife vehemently denies it.  The following transpired in a separate room on Sunday, while I was still chatting one on one with the Pastor after everyone else had left the room. \"I was on the couch, *she* came to *me* and asked me to sell them the house back.  I said we would, but I didn't say when or how and I was NOT crying.\"\\n\\nYou'd think this was one of those hearsay moments but as fortune would have it, she and I were having some friends over after the family talk, and one of them showed up early and came next door (my mother let them in), so they were sitting right there on the couch next to my wife.  I called them and they confirmed my wife's account of the events, insisting that my mom was full of shit.\\n\\nAt this point, my wife doesn't want to talk to or see my mom, and my mother in law gets wind of it and is pretty livid, too.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, my mom calls my wife as soon as I leave for work.  My wife didn't answer, so my mom comes next door, lets herself in, and begins a conversation (less a conversation and more a \"I'm going to talk and you're going to listen\") with my wife.\\n\\nNow, my wife is the sweetest person ever.  If you were so inclined, she'd let you walk all over her and apologize for being so lumpy.  She tells me, \"It's a good thing I was at the top of the stairs and she was at the bottom, cause otherwise I would have slapped her\".  In the seven years I've known this woman, only one other time have I ever seen her this angry.\\n\\nMy mother in law told me that my mom apparently left her a message.  She played it back to me; it was a combination of snippets of truth, peppered with distortions of things I had said reworded into things I hadn't, and ended with \"I'm sorry my son is ruining your daughter's life.\"\\n\\n**The current situation**\\n\\nMy parents don't even want to talk about \"the transgender thing\" until I \"make it right\".  If I don't sell them the house before 12/1, they probably won't be a part of my life anymore, and if they will, it'll be a wreck, considering I still have to live next door to them.  My sister has been remaining mostly neutral but she's siding with them in that if I don't give them what they want, she won't want me around either.  (Alt...   \n",

fall for school. He currently lives with his parents in a city about 3 hours away from our university, and I live with mine on the opposite side of the country. He has been in a bad financial situation after wrecking his car, and his construction work hasn't been giving him many hours. \\n\\nWhenever I talk to him he is always talking about his \"lazy days\" where he gets stoned and drunk and plays halo all day. \\n\\nSince I moved back to my city I've been working a full time and a part time job, and haven't gotten time off to visit him like I did last summer. In order to lock down a place for us to live in September I had asked him to check out places. I had looked online and emailed landlords, but he didn't have a car to go down to check them out. He got a ride once with his dad who goes down 2-3 times a week and looked at one place. I'm supposed to move out there in 2 weeks\\n\\n**The incident in question:**\\nA couple days ago I was talking to him on one of his \"lazy days.\" I was already pissy before I talked to him cause of work bullshit, but I asked him why he wasn't looking for places to live when his dad was down in our uni town. He said he \"wants a lazy day before he goes on his trip\" I asked him what trip he was talking about and he said he had decided to go on a two week long fishing trip with his buddy on his commercial tuna fishing boat. \\nI flipped out and told him I was really worried about finding a place to live and now he's gone for two weeks and I'm supposed to move out there in two weeks. He said his dad could look at houses and he needed this trip to make money. I was yelling at him and telling him he was immature and that me and his dad was doing more to help us find a place then he did. He said he really needs the money and he's gonna make a lot as a deck hand. \\nI said he was \"an asshole and being really immature and had been lazy and irresponsible all summer and that I would just find a place by myself and he could find his own place or sleep on the street cause he's too much of a baby to figure his shit out\"  he told me it works both ways and if I had come to visit him we could have found a place earlier. More swearing and name calling back on forth until he hung up on me. Now he's gone for ~2 weeks. \\n\\nI know he needs the money, so am I the asshole?\\n\\nTL;DR: broke boyfriend needs fish, pissed girlfriend needs a home   \n",

   So yesterday was my boyfriends birthday. Our two friends, him and I got a hotel room with two beds. Our other  friends from work (some of them have also been friends with my boyfriend for  a long time kind of invited themselves because they wanted to hang out with him and we just told them to get a room next door (total of like 8 people). The room was $140. \\n\\nThey decide they don't want to get it and they'll just come downtown and go home. Then they want to drink in our room before we go out, I told them to bring their own alcohol because I got two somewhat nice bottles and it wasn't enough for everyone (they also never pitch in for like anything, always claim their poor but most of them make even more than I do). \\n\\nThey get there and they brought a handle of Smirnoff (cheap vodka). My boyfriend ended up getting too drunk to go out, they still want to go and ask if they can stay in our room because they can't afford their own. This really pisses me off because there's eight of them, it's not that expensive to split $140 and there was not enough room in ours (12 people total). They invited more people without telling us (one who my boyfriend really doesn't get along with) and said they would give us some money if they could all sleep on the floor. \\n\\nWe ended up kicking them out. They were all really pissed and said they would get a room somewhere else. They drank all our alcohol and I think they even took  a bottle of my wine with them. They took the alcohol they brought as well, which is fine I'm just mad they drank all of ours because I wanted some of it for today. I feel bad but I wasn't trying to have a huge party in the room and I didn't want to deal with them all being drunk when they got back when we were just trying to have a calm night. Similar stuff has happened on multiple occasions because they \"don't have money\" ever.  I think my boyfriend probably would have let them stay but I don't think it's fair they act like that. \\n\\n\\nTldr: 8 friends came to our hotel room, didn't want to get their own after we told them to, drank all our alcohol and are mad because I told them to leave after my boyfriend got way too drunk     \n",

dad,  and my dad's girlfriend all moved in together out of state. I'll just call my boyfriend P. Well, dad's been ragging P's ass to get a job to help pay bills. Well, P got a job at a grocery store near by, expecting the night shift (higher pay, more hours.). He ended up getting the day shift. P told me that he was full time and that he would get night pay anyway since he was originally employed for night shift. I knew the night pay thing was bullshit and I let his lie slide. Turns out, my cousin C also works at the same store.  Well, fast forward to three weeks later. P was telling me about how one of his coworkers was bothering him about different things. So I told P to ignore it and take it up with the manager. Reasonable right? Well, the next day, P gets fired. He comes home, and I ask him what happened. He told me that when he went to the manager, the manager didn't like it and fired him. Odd. But I was like, okay. No big deal. That night, I texted C about P being fired. And C asked me how he got fired. Well, I told him what P told me. And he said no, that P got fired for making a racial remark in conversation with the BLACK manager. And when I asked C about P's pay, he said that P was only getting day shift pay, not only **that**, but he only applied for part time. . The conversation ended there. And I pulled P aside and chewed him out for lying to me about it. I was so mad that I screamed at him for being a hypocrite about lying. He says he hates liars and that he never lies..  Well when I was done ragging his ass about it, he tried to say that I was being unreasonable about it. I could see where he might be right. But now I wonder.. If he's going to lie about something that big, what else will he lie about? So Reddit, Am I The Asshole?     \n",

girlfriend  and I got back from an evening at the beach. We went to my house for a little bit just to spend some time together (she texted her mom to let her know that she was safe). We watched a TV show here and there and then spent the next few hours just talking to each other, kissing and cuddling. Without us realizing, it got a little late and we grew tired. She asked if she could take a quick nap which I said was no problem. However, I ended up falling asleep as well and when I came to, it was 2:00 in the morning. I realized that I was way too tired to safely drive her home and we ended up spending the night together and didnโt wake up until 7:00 this morning. My parents were already asleep by this time and I didnโt want to wake them and I hoped that theyโd be understanding. \\n\\nA few minutes after we were both awake, I made her breakfast and then drove her home. My mom was more understanding than her partner who said what I did was horrible and an asshole thing to do. My mom of course still wasnโt exactly pleased but she was happy to know that we didnโt have sex or anything (which I wouldnโt have done anyways because weโre not at that point yet.) Did I do the right thing last night or am I, like my momโs partner says, an asshole?\\n\\nAdditional Information: \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I are both close to 19 (she turns 19 next week and I turn 19 in three months)\\n\\nWe have been together for a little over a month\\n\\nMy momโs partner and I have been at each otherโs throats for 8 of the 13 years that she and my mom have been together. Which is why Iโm asking this on here because I know I might be a little biased when it comes to what she says. \\n\\n\\nEdit: Feel free to ask any further questions about the situation and I Will answer 100% honestly.\\n   \n",

                        Not sure if this is important, but I'm a female living in a gender neutral suite with two guys (Frank and Liam). They are my best friends at school, but we are currently not talking because we had an argument that eventually led to Frank's girlfriend (Tina) storming out over being called racist. I will paraphrase the conversation.\\n\\nFrank: Seriously guys, I know that I joke about being racist, but I'm really not. But, in my personal experience, every single black girl I've ever met has been really fucking rude and annoying.\\n\\nMe: ...No, that's definitely racist.\\n\\nFrank: It's really not because it's true [insert story here]\\n\\nMe: Just because that happened doesn't mean you can stereotype an entire group of people Frank wtf.\\n\\nTina: Throwawayparro, I've slept with this man for two years, he's no racist. I wouldn't sleep with a racist!\\n\\nMe: But literally what he just said was fucking racist, and honestly, you're racist! I've heard you say racist shit!\\n\\nTina: No I just talk about stuff that's happened to me. They're racist against me. They're all fucking like that. Blah blah, they get money for school and I don't just because of their skin color.\\n\\nFrank: Okay, FINE throwawayparro, I'm RACIST because of my PERSONAL EXPERIENCES.\\n\\n[Insert hour long argument about white privilege etc]\\n\\nLiam: Okay throwawayparro, my sister was once threatened by a black guy that he'd rape her and now she's scared of black guys. Can you really say that's racist?\\n\\nMe: I'm sorry that happened to her, but YES! That's racist! \\n\\nTina: There's no way that's racist, I can totally understand why she'd feel that way!\\n\\nEventually during this conversation, Tina admits that she really hates black people.\\n\\n[Insert me trying to explain what racism is and that even if you feel justified for hating a group of people, you're still racist]\\n\\nTina: Okay you know what you have no idea what I've been through and how hard my job has been because of all the awful shit black people say to me at my job, and you obviously DON'T CARE.\\n\\n[Tina proceeds to storm off]\\n\\n\\nSo basically the argument ended after that, there's a lot of other shit that happened but those are the barebone details. I guess it's important to mention that Tina honestly has had a really shitty life and it's hard for her to understand privilege because she's extremely poor, and I feel for her, but some of the things she said were still completely unacceptable to me. Now none of those three people will talk to me except Frank occasionally, it's been two days. AITA?   \n",

Museum.  Parking is expensive, so we parked at the edge of the city and took the subway.  We had a great day, and I was in a really good mood.  The subway was packed on our way back, but I didn't let it dampen my mood.  I stood holding the bar and I guess I had made eye contact with various people (mistake #1, I suppose).  This young woman sitting with a magazine says \"why are you smiling at me?\"\\n\\nMe, leaning forward: I'm sorry?\\nHer: You shouldn't smile at people.  It's insulting.\\nMe: Oh...sorry.\\n\\nThe whole thing had me really perplexed, which turned into annoyance.  Part of me wishes I'd reacted a little faster (\"if you think that's insulting, wait until you hear this one, lady...\").  Part of me also wondered if it was cultural, but she didn't have an accent at all (whatever that's worth).\\n\\nSo, am I the asshole here?  I completely understand if you call me a weirdo, but smiling at her wasn't really intentional.  Like I said, I was in a good mood.    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I was born with an anxiety disorder that has slowly destroyed my life since I was 13. I've gone through 2 psychiatrists and 1 psychologist specializing in neuro-feedback therapy. After dozens of therapy sessions, emergency hospital visits, and thousands of dollars worth of medical debt, my only form of control over my anxiety has been taking xanax for the past 6+ years. \\n\\nI've been with my girlfriend for over 3 years and my anxiety disorder has yet to be fully understood by her. We've had arguments before about it and she's said things like, \"Everyone stresses out all the time, you're not alone in this\" and \"All you need to do is thing positive thoughts and relax\" or \"Being addicted to drugs isn't the answer\". She can't seem to grasp the uncontrollable, life grasping, dark and depressing nature of anxiety and how it is a mental disorder and not just a mood swing. I think it's because she and her family have never dealt with mental disorder before and, like many of us redditors deal with, have no idea what the solution or results are.\\n\\nSo I went to her dentist's office today because I wanted to try a new dentist. When I went today, I asked her dentist if she could schedule the first cleaning for another time because I have anxiety and I need to take medicine to be able to be calm through even the most basic medical procedures. In fact, I start to hyperventilate, get short breath, and panic when I go to job interviews if I don't take xanax beforehand. So her dentist totally understood and told me she's there to make things as comfortable as I need. I was on the phone with my girlfriend just talking about my day and I told her this bit and she says, \"Why didn't you let her just do the cleaning? She would have let you relax or calm down if you needed to\" but it's not as simple as that. If I begin to get an anxiety attack, it will take a lot of downtime for me to get past it and the experience of it is too horrible for me to willingly go through. I tried to tell my girlfriend this and she says, \"Okay fine, whatever, I just think you don't need to pop pills all the time and should have just let her do her job.\" ... So I stayed silent for a bit and then just hung up on her. Now I'm pissed off at her and just wanna cuss her out.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? I have a god damn mental disorder that's plagued me for the past 10+ years and it will most likely stay with me for the rest of my life. I would have probably killed myself long ago if I didn't have xanax to keep my brain from going crazy and my body from self destructing. But it's all trivialized by my girlfriend, as if it's just something to shrug off my shoulder and easily fixed with a bright smile or something. \\n\\n**TL;DR: I need to take medicine before I even have a cleaning at the dentists office because of my anxiety but my girlfriend doesn't think my anxiety is a real problem and that I need to get over it.**   \n",

We were decent friends and we would hang out a good deal. After he got married, no one really saw him again. He was around, but was busy with his marriage and finishing up his degree (we were both in the same year of undergrad in different majors).\\n\\nSo we drifted apart. And then about 2.5 years ago, we basically stopped talking completely. He had moved off campus and was commuting to classes. It's cool. It happens. And neither one of us really made an effort to hang out with the other or make contact at all.\\n\\nFast forward to 2013- I proposed to my girlfriend and we started the engagement process. We started making invite lists and had to trim them down drastically. We got to my friend and decided that it would be alright if we didn't invite him and his wife. He had a bit of an argumentative attitude and we knew that he probably wouldn't get along with one of her family members. Plus, we figured it would be one of those situations where they knew we were getting married (yay for Facebook) and would be happy for us, but would understand not being invited since we had drifted so far apart.\\n\\nLast week, I received a series of texts from the first friend saying that they are severely hurt and upset that they included me in their wedding and now they don't even get invited to ours. \\n\\nI told him that I could see where he was coming from, and that we would love it if they could make it.\\n\\nHe gave me an address to send an invitation but told me that he probably couldn't get the time off work. \\n\\nMy thought was, \"Sooooo...you want me to send you an invitation to a wedding you weren't invited to...so that you can say that you can't make it?\"\\n\\nAm I in the wrong here? I get that I was his best man, but we honestly hadn't talked for at least two years. Was I wrong for assuming it was fine not to invite him?\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: Alright, so I was definitely in the wrong. I should have invited him regardless. Would you still say that it's asshole level or just bad form?   \n",

Instead of paying for a hotel room, she decided to crash at the dorm room of a friend she knew from undergrad. This guy's dorm room is small, and he only has a twin (single) bed. She told me that he refused to sleep on the floor, and said that the bed is big enough for the two of them. Now, this guy asked her a few months ago, during the summer and before we were dating, if she wanted him to eat her out. So I'm already uncomfortable with this situation. So I ask her if she would sleep on the floor, in order to soothe my worries. Keep in mind that this is only for two nights total. My girlfriend responded very negatively towards this, saying that I don't trust her, and that I need to stop micromanaging her while she's there. Am I the asshole in this situation?   \n",

I am just kind of posting here for my own sanity, and maybe to reflect in a \"change my view\" sort of way.\\n\\nMy girlfriend is a big fan of The 1975, a band that is gaining a lot of popularity right now. She has gotten me into this band also, and even though I had heard a few of their songs before, it's really to her credit that I listen to their music right now. But anyway, she has been into the band for probably over a year now. Recently, popular acts like One Direction, Taylor Swift, and 5 Seconds of Summer have cited the band as a favorite of theirs, giving them an influx of new fans who have not liked the band for as long. On top of this, the band is very popular with the \"hipster\" crowd online (especially on tumblr) and she seems to fit into that crowd on this issue. She often complains about the new fans, claiming that she is a bigger fan because she has followed the music for longer. She tends to get a very (excuse me for the bias here) elitist attitude, going as far as to say that the people who haven't liked the band for as long as she and some of the other fans have are only pretending to like them because it's somewhat the cool thing to do right now. She was very vocal in her complaints about the \"fourteen year olds\" who apparently are not mature enough to like this music and are only doing so because they saw One Direction tweet about them or something. She also claims that the concerts are \"kind of ruined now\" because all of these younger fans act viciously and violently to get near the stage and scream at the boys on stage, although I didn't see much of anything even close to this when we saw them in concert. She maintains that I couldn't possibly understand how violent fourteen year old girls are at concerts because I am a boy. In addition, I have pointed out that these fans are in exactly the same spot years ago when she was close to that age with acts like Justin Bieber and One Direction. I really don't mind her opinion, and it's not like an issue that we fight about or anything, but if it comes up I just kind of shake it off and nod my head while she rants about something I completely disagree with. I do not judge her for this nor do I think it's my place to try to \"correct\" her, but I just kind of needed to get this off of my chest and also confirm that it isn't ridiculous for me to be annoyed when she brings something like this up. Clearly it does bother me a little that we have such opposing viewpoints, enough even to post about it on reddit, but I really just need a second opinion, I don't plan on showing this to her or anything it's really just for my own comfort. Am I crazy to be annoyed at this \"I liked them before they were cool\" elitist attitude, or is it fair for her to be angry at young fans who, in her opinion, are not true fans and just following the crowd?   \n",

                                                        We were alone at my girlfriends apartment. My girlfriend was complaining about how everything hurts and that her family doesn't care to take her to the doctor for a check up. She has been complaining about some things more and her family won't take her. I offered to take her and she said no. She started to complain about her knee felling worse. I lost it when she said she has never been able to see a doctor, \"Only the nurse at her school\".  I said \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" she got pissed and said to never swear at her or her family again. I think I crossed the line, but its like she lured me into it. I then asked her if she knew why I got frustrated, she said yes and then she said she had to study.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                         My wife decided in early 2013 that she no longer wanted to be married.  She sat me down and said she just did not love me, and she did not want to live out our \"suburban life\" that we had planned. \\n\\nSome context:  I was 26 she was 24 at the time, we were married at 24 and 22, and had been married for just over 2 years when she decided this.  We both grew up in a smaller town in Illinois, went to the same college, and got married just after graduating.  We dated each other a total of 3 years before we got married, so it's not like we just rushed into things, in my opinion.  \\n\\nWe moved out of the small town less than a year after getting married to a large suburb just outside of Chicago.  I had secured a job in the town we moved to, and not long after moving my wife found a great job in Chicago, which was a decent commute on the train every day.  Instantly our lives were very different, we went from seeing each other every day for breakfast and most of our evenings, to me dropping her off at the train in the wee morning hours and picking her up usually after dinner.  She started spending more and more time in the city going out with her coworkers and friends, and complaining that she had no friends or things to do in the suburbs where we lived.  \\n\\nWell we ended up finding a great deal on a house in the suburbs and bought it.  This was in November of 2013.  We purchased it for 100,000 with a 5,000 down-payment that I paid out of my personal IRA (a special rule allows for first time homeowners to use IRA money penalty free up to 10,000). \\n\\nAt this time her job started to take off (she is a recruiter for accounting and finance jobs), to the level that it put her on track to make $150,000 in 2014.  I make approximately 47,000 at my job, and it is salaried, no commission will increase it like hers.\\n\\nAnyway, she decided in February that she no longer wanted to be together which started a long period of me begging her not to leave, and her saying she had made up her mind and there was nothing that was going to change that.  \\n\\nI felt it was fishy at the time, I had not treated her poorly or done anything I felt was worthy of being divorced over, but she assured me she just wasn't happy with where her life was going and wanted to try something different.  \\n\\nIn May of 2014 she moved into an apartment in Chicago with a few girls, and as of next week we will be officially divorced.  I tried to reconcile multiple times over the last 10 months, but to no avail.\\n\\nAll of this is important because when she split she said I could have the house, as it is not paid off, I will have the benefit of keeping the house, but will incur the mortgage myself.  By the time she left we had paid off $23,000 in total, including the $5,000 down payment.   Two days ago she e-mailed me and stated that I needed to refinance and take out an additional $10,000 that is owed to her for half of what was paid on the house.\\n\\nI do not think I owe her anything, she was living in the house and still married while we were paying on it, and she made the decision to leave.  So i'm just wondering if I'm the asshole for not wanting to give her that money?     \n",

and has to go into the hospital like twice a week, usually from about 10 pm to 4 am. If we're fighting about something at this time, she'll tell me she can't deal with us right now and that I'm stressing her out. Whenever she has to go into the hospital I feel obligated to stay up with her but honestly I'm missing copious amounts of sleep. Am I the asshole for just wanting to go to bed when she has to go to the hospital? Or for not viewing her heart failure as a valid excuse to get out of arguments? If you need any more details I'd be glad to elaborate.\\nThanks!   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                         My girlfriend has somewhat of a short attention span. Whether we're at home sitting on the couch or eating dinner together at a restaurant or just generally talking to one another, sometimes I'll start to talk and I notice that she isn't actually paying attention. Here are some of the signs:\\n\\n1. She's facing me but her eyes are looking at something around the corner, constantly shifting between me and whatever she's looking at, all the while saying, \"mhmm, yeah... uh huh\"\\n2. She randomly interrupts me to point out something unimportant and meaningless, e.g. \"OH! I didn't know this store was at this location! We have to go there soon. My bad, go on.\"\\n3. The infamous glued to cellphone texting someone else while trying to maintain communication with me.\\n\\nAnd the usual stuff like just zoning out, etc.\\n\\nNow I'm not an attention whore by any means. I've learned a lot about our relation the last few years and I know what interests my girlfriend and what I should talk to my friends about, but this isn't even a specific type of conversation here. We could be talking about how our day has been, in fact she could be the one asking me this question and when I answer, she will sometimes just stop listening to what I have to say. I've gotten used to it by now, so I'll even have a little fun with it sometimes. When I notice her drifting off, I'll make up silly stuff to see if she catches it, like, \"Yeah so Nancy got fired today at work because an elephant walked into our office asking if we sold oversized headphones it could wear and she said we don't.\"\\nOr I'll just prematurely finish what I had to say, like \"Yeah so Nancy... nah nvm it's not even important. How was your day?\"\\n\\nAnd now we get to the point. Recently, my girlfriend and I went to a coffee shop near by and sat down to enjoy ourselves. I started to talk about the marathon my friend joined and how we should give it a try but I noticed she was looking from the corner of her eye at this odd couple sitting next to us. She interrupts me mid sentence and says:\\n\\nGF: \"Honey don't we know those two people from somewhere?\"\\n\\nMe: \"I dunno\" and just stopped talking\\n\\nGF: \"Sorry, what were you saying?\" \\n\\nMe: \"Nothing, never mind\"\\n\\nGF: \"I said sorry, jeez. Why are you always like this?\"\\n\\nMe: \"What? I'm just not going to waste my energy talking when you don't care.\"\\n\\nGF: \"What's your problem?\"\\n\\nMe: \"Nothing, I'm just tired of being interrupted and ignored. Don't you think it's rude to do that? I always listen to you and anyone else that talks to me because I actually care, but sometimes you just don't care, so I don't care either.\"\\n\\nGF: \"Relax, I just wanted to know if you knew who they were. Why do you have to be so sensitive about this all the time? I'm listening to you.\"\\n\\nMe: \"Okay, so what was I talking about then?\"\\n\\nGF: \"Fine, whatever.\"\\n\\nThis has happened to me all my life because my family has always ignored me. Thus, I've always been courteous to other people by doing something as simple as listening to them when they talk. My girlfriend's closest friend and cousin is exactly like this and I've actually had arguments with them in the past about this type of thing being disrespectful to the person talking to you but they think it's trivial.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? Do I not have a point? I get that sometimes we all have thoughts in our heads that suck up all of our attention but this happens very frequently.\\n\\n**TL;DR Girlfriend has a short attention span, interrupts me when I'm talking because of something trivial and I can't stand it, so I stop talking.**   \n",

Was hanging with my girlfriend of 2 years today and her 2 friends when white people got brought up (I am white, gf is Filipino, friend 1 is white and friend 2 is asian.) Friend 1 was saying how much she hated white people and all of the stereotypes that come with it while gf and friend 2 are agreeing. I do the whole \"Wow, you guys are so racist, not all of us are like that\" and things are getting louder as they are (jokingly but with conviction) that we all are and I feel a hand slap across my face and look up to see my girlfriend looking at me with a slightly remorseful face and her hand coming back to her side. I'm thouroughly pissed that she did that and immediately left with them yelling behind me still about white people. I text her later that night saying something like \"yeah ya know i hate all filipinos too. they are FOBs and just eat dogs.\" still playing along with the racism. Now I didn't actually feel this way but wanted to show her how it felt. Convo continued like this when she says you can't be racist againt white people. \\n\\nNow I'm pissed about this and her hitting me so i say \"wow babe, your usually smart but that sentence just dropped your IQ by 25 points\". She restates her sentence and convo goes on without more insults.\\n\\nThe next day after we stopped texting I meet up with her and she says she is very offended with what I said and dumps me. I just really don't say much as I don't think she is that serious but she walks away and texts me about how hurt she is. I later did find out that it was her friend that grabbed her hand and hit me with it but at the time I was pissed and acted impulsively. Am I the asshole for getting that mean with her or is she overreacting?\\n\\nEDIT: to add, this isnt the first time that weve insulted eachother. she has said to me (of course jokingly) to fuck off, I fucking hate you, you fucking ass and etc. ive said my fair share back so its not like I broke any previous insult boundaries either.   \n",

                                                                             Throwaway because this is work-related. Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to be concise. \\n\\nI own and run a company together with three male partners. I'm the fourth partner, and female. A few weeks ago, I was trying to hand over an important project to one of my partners before I went on vacation. While I was briefing him, he interrupted me a number of times and went off on lengthy tangents - so often, and so lengthy, that it was becoming difficult to  give him all of the info he needed to complete the project without me. This bothered me, and I must have gotten snippy (I didn't realize it at the time), because when I left the room for coffee, he turned to another partner and said: \"Do you know what I would say to my wife if she spoke to me like that?\" And then proceeded to bark in that partner's face like an angry dog.\\n\\nI caught the tail end of this, and when he realized I had overheard, he repeated the whole thing, trying to play it off as a harmless joke. I was pretty taken aback and couldn't immediately compute what he had just said and what the implications were. I told him that I hadn't realized my tone was out of line, apologized, and that was that.\\n\\nNow, weeks later, his comment still irks me. Hardcore. This is blatant sexism, and it's in my innermost work circle, I own a business with these people. The problem is, because of my vacation, weeks have passed since it happened - and I haven't spoken to him about it. By now, I feel like the fact that I can't let it go is more a reflection of my own limitations - my white-hot anger when it comes to sexism and my inability to be chill about it - than of the crassness of the incident itself.\\n\\nOK, so here's the AITA. The fact that he said this has made me lose respect for him. I genuinely like him less, and I think it's starting to show in our daily interactions. I don't really enjoy talking to him, so I only strike up a conversation if I have to. The tone is always professional and polite, but I wouldn't say friendly, and the frequency of our conversations has dropped. And when he interrupts me now, I just keep on talking and bulldoze right over him. This especially has made him notice that something is going on, but since the incident happened a few weeks ago, he has no idea what he did wrong. \\n\\nI should add that I was brought on board explicitly to add structure/professionalism to the company. We work in a creative field and before I joined the team, it was kind of a crazy, non-productive free-for-all. I've been fairly successful in implementing discipline, but it's been a long and hard fight... Which has resulted in my being labelled as the company nag. This is the main reason why I haven't brought the issue up. It is absolutely vital that I pick my battles.\\n\\nI also believe that deep-seated sexism isn't something you can talk someone out of.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not explaining to my partner how sexist his comment was?\\n\\nTLDR: Was unable to immediately call out business partner about sexist comment, comment still bothers me, it's starting to creep into our daily interactions, but I still haven't spoken to him about it. Am I being a passive aggressive asshole?\\n\\nEdit: Changed first sentence to clarify that I am not an office manager, as some readers thought, but a partner.   \n",

live together and have a child together. Her sister babysits for us while we are working. My girlfriend told me that she was just picking our daughter up after work and would not be hanging out... cut to later... no text or call letting me know that she had decided to stay and hang out so I am left wondering if she is ok or if something happened... it puts me in an awkward position because now I have to contact her to see whats going on... and I hate looking or sounding possessive. Now shes mad at me because \"I scolded her\" when in reality its just that I care about her and my daughter and dont want anything to happen to them... and I certainly dont want to be in a position of not knowing where to start looking if something were to happen... am I an asshole?   \n",

                                                     **TL;DR my boyfriends good friend/flatmate is very passive aggressive and goes out of her way to control us (which she has some right to as it's her house). Am I a bad girlfriend for no longer making an effort to be friends when my boyfriend really wants everyone to get along? I used to be friendly but now I'm just civil and nothing more unless she talks first.**\\n\\n\\nI've been dating my boyfriend John for a month. His flatmate, Jane, is a good friend of his who he works with. When Johns ex dumped him Jane offered her house to him. She insisted that he not pay any rent and they agreed that he stay for roughly a month. That was in January. \\n\\n\\nWhen John first moved in Jane jumped him on the couch and tried to kiss him and initiate sex. John politely turned her down because he doesn't believe in sleeping with flatmates/coworkers. I'm honestly fine with this - I can understand being attracted to John :) I didn't even meet him until a month later. **I do not do anything \"couply\" with John in front of her. I have never kissed him or told him I liked him in front of her**. \\n\\n\\nJane and I were friendly at first but then she started becoming extremely passive aggressive. She suddenly refused to talk to either of us and would sometimes demand that we leave the house at 11pm because she \"wanted space\" and we couldn't come back until the next day... And even then John had to come back alone. On our first night as a couple she got drunk and started screaming on the phone at her friend about how much she hated John and wanted to live alone - she did this from like 8m away and knew we could hear her. I'm very conservative and shy around strangers so on the rare occasion she talks to me she likes to push subjects to try and make me uncomfortable, such as telling me to wear nipple tassels with her and discussing my breasts (her boyfriend I barely knew was next to her). \\n\\n\\nNow, I'm of the belief that whoever has the house makes the rules so we should just shut up and deal with it until John finds a new place. The thing is, I only visit once a week and Jane always holds that over Johns head. He has tried to pay her rent several times and each time Jane refuses but then tries to control him by saying \"no you can't do this/have your girlfriend visit because you don't pay any rent\". He always pays utilities though. Jane has also told John multiple times that she doesn't mind that he stay longer despite the initial agreement only being for a month. \\n\\n\\nEvery time Jane does something bad she apologises later and says she knows she's being unreasonable but then she goes and does it again. \\n\\n\\nJohn has been applying for new houses every day but been unsuccessful because our city has a huge housing crisis. Jane is still insisting that it's fine that he stay with her until then and that it's okay if I visit once a week (she always says it's fine but complains later, saying that she hates my laugh or she wanted space). \\n\\n\\nAfter this, I never ask to visit John unless John and Jane ask me. I have never been anything but polite to Jane's face (although I've told John I can't understand why he wants to be friends with someone who controls him when he's 27) and everytime I come over I smile genuinely and greet her but now neither of us bother with conversation. \\n\\n\\n**I'm NOT after a solution (obviously he needs to move out or I need to stop visiting when she says it's okay), I just want to know if I'm an asshole for not bothering to try and make things up to Jane when it's only been a measly month, considering he still wants to stay friends with her (everyone says she has a really nice side that I haven't seen) and I think girlfriends should always make an effort to be nice to people their boyfriends care about.**\\n\\nJohns abusive ex refused to meet his friends and family. When she finally met his friends at a work function she left without telling him because she was bored. He was humiliated. A year later she finally met his mother and constantly complained about how she was forced to be there and even left early alone to catch a 2hr bus to the airport to get home - they were only visiting for two days. I'm trying to help John to a better place after the shit his ex did and I'm worried that by giving up with Jane I am being like his ex. Yes, I know he has awful taste.   \n",

I told my parents I would be out late and asked them to not wait up for me because I didn't know what time I'd be home. \\n\\nSo about 1:00 I get an angry text from both parents saying \"you're being extremely inconsiderate\" and \"you better get your ass home, now.\" \\n\\nI understand that I live under their roof and it's their rules, but I pre-warned them. Is 20 not old enough to stay out past curfew? I've never been a bad kid. I've always done everything I can to appease my parents. These last couple years though, it's begun to affect my relationships. No man wants to hear, \"sorry we can't go out tonight, my parents want me home by 9:00.\" So I've started venturing a little. Should I just stop until I move out?\\nAny advice on how to handle this is more than welcome!   \n",

my girlfriend and she's too passive to say no to family and friends. She's going to prom no matter what. (I'm sure she'll  have lots of fun too.) She obviously doesn't want to go alone, so people suggested she ask her ex out as a \"date\". They're just friends and there's no chance of anything bad going on with them during prom, but I can't stop being so jealous. I don't like him being called her date and I don't like the thought of people possibly seeing them as going out or anything. Sorry if this is a bad submission, I've obviously never done this before.\\n\\nEDIT: Oh my gosh guys, I'm so sorry I didn't update! :( So all is fine. Nothing happened at her prom and she did have a nice time. (Is that what you all wanted to know? I mean, there's not much to say.)   \n",

                                   My boyfriend is a great guy, but he doesn't like piercings or tattoos at all. Which kind of surprised me when I found out, since I already had a nosepiercing and a few ear piercings when we met. He told me he'd prefer it if i took them out, and I told him I'd prefer to keep them and that was that - or so I thought.\\n\\nI really wanted some more ear piercings, since one of my ears was kind of empty compared to the other. I mentioned this to my boyfriend, who tried to talk me out of it, and to compromise with me only getting one piercing (I wanted two). I wasn't really in  the mood for a discussion, so i just let it go.\\n\\nA few months later I finally decided to get the piercings done anyway and asked two of my friends to go to a piercer with me. The night before getting pierced I gave my boyfriend - who was in London for a language training week at that time - a heads up via WhatsApp. I knew he wasn't going to be thrilled, but his only response was along the lines of \"Well... if you think you'll look prettier :)\" Suprisingly positive, so I figured he'd be okay with it. I went ahead with it and got my ear pierced (conch and rook in case that's relevant).\\n\\nThe next day I visited my boyfriend. I had my hair in a ponytail, so the piercings were clearly visible. He didn't comment on them at all though, so I figured they didn't bother him too much. Turns out he didn't even notice them...\\n\\nFast forward a week: my boyfriend is staying at my place. I notice him staring at my new piercings. \"What the hell is that? Are those the new piercings? Why?\" and a few minutes later \"I can't even tell you how much I don't like them\" He's devastated. And I mean literally. He pleaded with me to take them out for about 10 minutes, after I refused he proceeded to sulk for good 30 minutes. I asked him why he didn't object before I got my piercings done, since if I took them out now the money I paid for them and the pain of a needle piercing through my ear would all have been for nothing. His response was \"Well, I was in London at that time...\"\\n\\nWhatever... I figured I'd just keep my hair down when he was aroud now, because if he can't see the piercings he's not going to complain about them, right? Well, not really... It worked for a while, but we were cuddling this morning and he pressed his head against my ear unintentionally. I said \"Ouch, you touched my piercings\" which sent him in sulk mode all over again. I decided that I wouldn't waste my Saturday by staying at my sulking boyfriends place. Before I left he said \"Get home safely. Oh, and I don't like that entire piercing thing at all\" \"Well yeah, I noticed\"\\n\\nThat's pretty much the whole story. And we're both 18 in case that's relevant. Am I the asshole here?   \n",

                                                                 Recently at a family gathering for a meal and people were seated in various places around the house for a casual โserve yourselfโ type of meal. My wife was sitting in the dining room with a few other people and I had been in the living room. After eating I decided to join her in the dining room to join in the conversation there. When I first got to the room there were no chairs and I stood for a few minutes. At some stage someone grabbed another chair and a seat became available so I sat in one. In the process some chairs where moved and my wife stood up to accommodate the shifting/moving chairs. She then found that in the shuffle that she didnโt have a seat. She then looked at me and said โHey, you stole my chair!โ .\\n\\n\\nNow to be clear, the chair I sat in became free just before the shuffle and was not the exact chair she was sitting in. I canโt remember what I said exactly but I was a bit stunned and confused by the accusation. I offered to have our son sit on my lap to free up a seat. He didnโt want to so I apologised and went back to the living room.  I was actually a little annoyed by the whole situation, but  kept it to myself. Later in the car my wife voiced her opinion to me that she didnโt appreciate my reaction in front of the whole family. A small argument over the semantics of the exact wording of the situation ensued. Her basic point is that I should have been more pleasant in the situation and not made a fuss, my point was that I thought it was rude that she said I stole her chair when in fact I didnโt, I thought a more apt statement would have been โhey I missed out on a chair nowโ.\\n\\n\\nWas I wrong to feel it was rude of her to blame me for losing a chair? Iโm at a loss to how I could have handled the situation any differently. Perhaps it would have been better to offer her my chair and apologise? Am I the asshole?\\n\\n\\n**edited for spelling and formatting**   \n",

gonna be receiving her LNA license after a semester of work at a local community college. She wanted me to take time off of work but I told her that she shouldn't count on me going because it's hard to find someone to cover your shift where I work. Well it turned out that I didn't have to work on the day of her graduation, which was this past Wednesday at 6 PM. Even so I told her that I wasn't 100% certain that I could go as I didn't want to disappoint her if something came up. \\n\\nOn Tuesday my Dad went to court to fight a reckless driving case and lost. He won't get his license back until July. He then called me and asked if I could drive him around and work with him Wednesday. He is a welder and makes most his money off of traveling around the area and welding people's trucks, boats, etc. I really didn't wanna leave my dad hanging so I said yes. We worked from 7 AM to around 5PM Wednesday (the day of my girlfriend's license receiving if you're not paying attention) and by 5 I was bone tired. I texted my GF and she asked me what I had been doing all day. So I explained and told her that I was extremely tired. She said that it would be alright if I didn't go. I asked her if she was sure and she said yes. After that she stopped replying for the rest of the day, not unusual since she was probably busy. Early Thursday morning I texted her and got nothing but crickets. When she did reply she was pissed off that I didn't show up and said that she didn't care that I was tired and that she just wanted me to be there. We had a fight about it and now she's more pissed off than before I think. The thing is, if she had said no when I asked her if she was sure I absolutely would've gone. \\n\\nWhat say you reddit? \\n\\n**Update: My girlfriend came over and after talking for awhile we decided that it's best if we don't see each other anymore. For the reason above and others.**\\n\\nEdit: Those who say I'm an asshole, how should I go about remedying my fuck up?   \n",

I am a 22yr old male about to graduate college. This happened yesterday, mothers day, at work. I work at a restaurant in downtown chicago, and for those of you who don't know, mothers day is our second busiest day of the year, so I already wasn't in the best mood.  \\n\\nI work with my roommate and my girlfriend, me and my roommate work in the same section, and my girlfriend works as a hostess on the other side of the restaurant. There are 3 other important people in this story, coworker 1 (C1), coworker 2 (C2), and chef. \\n\\n\\nSo now to actually start the story. It was a hectic day at work and we had two new people working, which just made matters worse. When I first showed up I saw my roommate and gf whispering to each other, saying something like \"did you tell him yet?\". Me, knowing they were talking about me, asked them what they were talking about, and they just changed the subject. This happened about 1-2 more times that day, but I just kicked it to the back of my mind, as that day was very busy\\n\\n I could go into all the garbage I went through at work that day, but I will skip it to be concise. Basically, I wasn't in the best of moods at this time, but things were dying down and I was looking forward to leaving. I went in the back, and C1, my roommate, and the chef were all laughing in the back. When C1 saw me he shouted \"dumbass got her pregnant!\" my roommate then told him \"no she didn't tell him yet!\" At this point I was beginning to get flustered, and the chef and C1 were telling me what I should have done not to get my girlfriend pregnant, with C1 telling me what a big mistake it was when he had a baby at my age.\\n\\nThey continued to grill me, but I just stood there and took it, as there was someone up front I was helping get food for. I went back up front and took care of the customer, and my mind started racing with thoughts. Is she really pregnant? Why did she tell everyone else first? Needless to say, I start to freak out a bit. The only time me and her had talked about kids is when we talked about how much we don't like and don't want them. So I called her over, and the conversation went like this.\\n\\nMe: \"So people have been saying some things about you, is there anything you need to tell me?\"\\n\\nHer: \"Maybe\"\\n\\n*At this point my heart starts pounding, this isn't looking good*\\n\\nMe: \"well what does that mean? If you have something to tell me you can just tell me\"\\n\\nHer: \"not at work\"\\n\\n*I'm starting to freak the fuck out, the only reason she wouldn't want to tell me at work is if it was something serious.* \\n\\nMe: \"does it have to do with\" *points to uterus*\\n\\nHer: \"yes\"\\n\\n*my eyes grow wide, my hands start shaking, I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack*\\n\\nMe: \"are you pregnant?\"\\n\\nHer: \" yes, I'm pregnant\"\\n\\nI take a step back, as my brain starts to process the gravity of what she just said. I feel the adrenaline kicking through my body, I have no idea how to respond. I'm staring at her wide-eyed, when my roommate jumps out from behind the door, and they both scream\" surprise!\". This does not help with my anxiety, as my heart beats faster. My gf then says \" just kidding I wasn't really pregnant!\". My roommate \"yeah we got you!\". My mouth is open, blood is kicking and I cannot make words come out of my mouth. I say,\"I need to be alone right now\". I then go to the bathroom to try and calm down, be alone, and process. This feels like the start to a panic attack, but I calm myself down a little bit and go back up front. \\n\\nThere was a customer up there looking to place an order and throughout the conversation my words aren't coming out right, and I'm still flustered. When I hand him my pen to sign the check, I bump into him  because I can't controll my hand. I am obviously not calmed down yet. I go to the back and my roommate attacks me. \"Why are you being so weird?\", \"you should have known it was just a joke\", \"quit being a bitch\". To which I respond shut the fuck up, don't tell me how to feel, and you almost gave me a panic attack. He keeps trying to get in my face to force me to calm down, which was making me even more upset, and I tell him to watch upfront because I need to be alone right now, and cool off.\\n\\nAs I am going towards the bathroom again, my girlfriend intercepts me. \"Did I ever tell you how much I adore you?\" I can still feel the adrenaline pumping through me, and I just stare at her. She goes in to hug me and I am still freaking out, but I try to hug her back, which turns into a weird half hug. She gets upset with me and storms off. \\n\\nI then go back into the bathroom and cool off for about fifteen minutes, which helps, and then go back to finally finish my shift. I look for my gf to talk this out, but she already went home. Great. now she's mad at me. I later learn that this whole joke was orchestrated by C2, but it was supposed to go like this.\\n\\nHer: \"why haven't you wished me a happy mothers day?\"\\n\\nMe: \"why would I?\"\\n\\nHer:\"because I'm pregnant!\"\\n      \"just kidding!\"\\n\\n When I got off of work, I texted saying sorry that I got upset, but I was so flustered I couldn't say anything. no reply. So tell me, am I the asshole for responding how I did?\\n\\nTL;DR: coworkers and girlfriend pretend she is pregnant, I almost have a panic attack, turns out they were just kidding. Now everyone is mad at me.\\n   \n",

                                                                                  I want to know if I'm the asshole in a fight that my boyfriend of three years and I are currently having. \\n\\nA little background: I just had a baby three weeks ago and am currently taking care of her mostly on my own while my boyfriend works and breastfeeding every two hours. I have mostly been camped out on the couch. Normally, I am working and my boyfriend has plenty of time alone to masturbate, and I have recently been privy to his habits a little more than I'm used to. I try to be understanding, since I am currently unable to have sex until six weeks postpartum. I am not against masturbation in any way - I masturbate and think it's healthy. I am, unfortunately, slightly bothered by porn use. I don't like to admit it, but it does irk me a little when I know he's whacking it to porn (he gets up in the middle of the night to do it). I have never said anything about it in the past, because I know guys are visual and masturbation is a different, more personal thing than having sex with your partner. He has a very high sex drive. I have also tried to continue being intimate with him and have given him a few blow jobs, maybe two a week or so, since coming home from the hospital. We normally have sex nearly every day. I am exhausted as well as sexually frustrated.\\n\\nThis morning I had to take the baby to the doctor. He knew this, but he was unsure of the time I was leaving. I was nursing her on the couch and he came out of the bedroom to get the laptop and went back into the bedroom, announcing that he was going to masturbate. This bothered me and I said in a frustrated tone, \"I'm leaving in an hour!\" thinking he could just wait until I left, which would be preferable for me because I don't really like sitting in the adjacent room awake while he masturbates, but also, I thought, to him, because he wouldn't have to feel bad about me sitting out there, he could have the sound on, or whatever.\\n\\nHe gets upset and I get upset back. I said, angrily, that he could just wait for me to leave and have time to masturbate to his favorite porn star all day! We argue and I leave, and I've been stewing all day about how selfish and insensitive he is. I say that he can be more sensitive to how I feel about him masturbating whenever and wherever since I am sexually frustrated and exhausted taking care of a baby and he says I have no right to tell him when or where to masturbate or what to do with his body. \\n\\nHe is also stuck on the fact that I don't like porn and is now saying I don't want him to masturbate ever, which isn't true. He says I can't say I don't want him to masturbate in the room next to me while I'm awake and then also say I'm okay with masturbation. He also says since I've never said anything about him masturbating to porn bothering me before that I am a liar and have not been upfront in our relationship. In reality, I have asked him to clear the history because I don't like to see what he masturbates to. I feel my dislike of porn use is irrational, so mostly I ignore it. I have never told him not to use porn and don't expect that from him at all... I just don't like thinking about him jerking it in the room next to me while I'm sitting there!\\n\\nHopefully this makes some sense - I probably rambled a little too much. So, am I the asshole?   \n",

What I want to know is what others have to say about this whole situation. I've never had any real bouts with family so, I'm feeling a bit caught off guard about all of this, if nothing else.\\n\\nSo here's what happened:\\n\\nMy Grandpa passed away recently (early April), relatively unexpectedly and tragically. I booked an emergency flight home from abroad as soon as I had news about funeral arrangements. I was home for about a week, just enough time to get settled in at home, be there for the funeral and spend sometime with family. Even though I had just been back in the States two weeks prior for a planned visit, original plans were suddenly changed with the deterioration in my grandpas health, landing him in the hospital twice in the last week and a half.\\n\\nLet me back up in potential build-up of drama by stating the following:\\n\\nOnce the news of his death came to me, having waited overnight, not to mention giving myself a chance to calm down as the news was hard to take as I was very close to my Grandpa, and he was my last grandparent, I changed my Facebook profile to the original picture of a 1952 portrait of my grandparents I have tattooed on my shoulder blade. I also changed my profile banner to a picture of my Grandpa with two of my favorite cousins and I during the last time I was in Georgia with my family (2008, the spring after my Grandma, his wife, has passed from Alzheimer's). Going to GA for Easter used to be a family tradition up until I'd say the last 12 years ago or so. Since then, it has become much more sporadic because of my Grandparents health slowly deteriorating as they aged (and public schools spring break not lining up with Easter any more).\\n\\nAnyway, moving on: shortly after changing my pictures, my aunt Tami (married to my Mom's brother), sent me a message that said \"OP:... My son doesn't know yet.\" To which I asked if she wanted me to change them. She said yes. I didn't.\\n\\nInstead, I replied that I didn't see what the problem was. I didn't post a status / any words about what had happened. I simply changed my pictures. I also noted that I wasn't even friends with her son on FB. She retaliated that there was still GA family that didn't know about what had happened and that FB wasn't the place for them to find out. I agreed, but reaffirmed that I only changed my pictures specifically for that reason. *No further correspondence.*\\n\\nThe weekend after the funeral, the family began work on Grandpas house to get it ready to put up for sale on the open market. As we began to start clearing it out for renovations, the majority of the family was there making piles of trash, donation, and keep. Having recently moved 4,000+ miles away to Germany, I opted not to keep much of anything save for a few sentimental items:\\n* Good Housekeeping cookbook 1969 (containing a few recipies I knew him and Grandma used)\\n* Family Genealogy book\\n* Military uniform, ribbons and medals\\n* Letters from Grandpa to Grandma while in the AF stationed in Germany circa August - February 1952 (my other cousin, Britt, kept the remainder of the stack of letters from 1953 and 1969).\\nI wanted to keep his military photo album too, but Mom said not yet. Of the few things I kept, I went through the house checking with every member of my family that they did not want the items I wanted. I always asked my uncle Mike first, as he was the eldest remaining child. No one had any objections.\\n\\nA few days after the clean up, I left to come back to my new home across the pond. Not a week after being back, my Mom was messaging me telling me not to be surprised if Tami sends me a message asking for Grandpas military medals. Confused, she explained that Tami and her daughter Sarah, wanted to make a special memorial display of the flag presented to Mike at the funeral and include Grandpa's original military medals and ribbons in his honor as a gift to Mike for Father's Day.\\n\\nUpon request (and without my knowledge), my Mom told Tami that she had the medals, but that they meant a lot to me and she would check with me before letting her have them. She also suggested to get duplicate medals and ribbons from and army surplus store. Unfortunately, this solution is not favorable by the requesting party. I'm not sure what happened after that, but I did not receive any correspondence from Tami.\\n\\nFast-forward to just the other day:\\nMy cousin Sarah (Mike and Tami's daughter), sent me a message again requesting Grandpas military medals and ribbons. She noted that her dad \"didn't ask for much when we were cleaning the house since he was just trying to hold it together.\" I responded cordially stating that I think the display is a wonderful and thoughtful gift idea for her father, but that I feel it is important the original medals and ribbons stay with his original uniform. I reinforced the purchase of duplicate medals and ribbons for Mike's display, as I wanted to make a shadow box display of my own showcasing Grandpas military memorabilia, and that it would look weird with new medals and an old uniform. Furthermore, I suggested incorporating his service certificates (which Mike actually *DID* want) into the display. Sarah said in her response message to me that she was, \"not trying to take Grandpas things from [me but is] trying to do something for [her] dad who's having a hard time.\" I replied to her, that I only took a total of 4 items the day of the initial clean and that while she isn't \"trying\" to take something from me, she *would* be taking a huge part of the 1 out of 4 things I have to remember our Grandpa by. I concluded the message by saying \"I hope you understand.\"\\n\\nHer only response: \"I don't at all.\"\\n\\nA few minutes later, she posts a status that says \"Wow how my eyes have been opened over the last month and a half!\" I \"liked\" it out of irony. She immediately sends me a message that says, \"Do me a favor and don't like my status. Delete me if you want. I just don't care anymore.\" One of her friends commented with concern about what the status was about. She replied simply stating \"People who only think about themselves.\" Clearly, the status is about me (should I make a point here that I am considerably younger than her?).\\n\\nI didn't condone her messages with a response but rather, a lack of action or response. \\n\\nWell Reddit, that's what happened. No words since. I'm not sure how to feel about this. Mostly I want to say \"fuck it,\" but I can't seem to let it go because 1) This is surprising to me and 2) Grandpa wouldn't want this and it makes me sad.\\n\\nStill though, I keep having to fight the urge to say something to her \\n\\nAM I THE ASSHOLE HERE?!   \n",

She has a long commute and gets home at 715 and I get home around 5. We both make about the same amount I just have a nicer work life balance. \\nSo lately she's been mad that I don't have dinner ready for her when she gets home. I clean up the apartment every day. Including all her shit she leaves out in the morning. We cook together, and split rent. But she thinks I should be getting groceries and working out and cooking dinner every night before she gets home instead of relaxing and waiting to cook with her. I like that we cook together and I've shared that with her she just thinks I should do more chores since I have more time at home. It's not like she brings any more to the equation or anything. \\n\\nSo am I the asshole for spending my alone time on things I like (like playing xbox) and waiting to cook and get groceries together?   \n",

She made it clear a number of times she wanted him to leave me and be with her, including sending him a tape of her masterbating. It was really hurtful he continued to.be her friend for so long. Nothing physical happened between the two of them, but they did hang out. On one occasion he even forgot that we were meeting for lunch because I needed help carrying a lunch tray as I was walking with crutches due to a knee injury. He went to lunch with her because she was having a bad day while I waited around like an idiot. He didn't even call me, so I found this out that night when he got back from class. He said he felt bad for her because she found out she had MS and her boyfriend was a serial cheater, etc. I never told him he had to cut her out of his life because I don't think it is right to dictate who he spent his time with, even though it really hurt me. He even considered having us \"take a break\" when she told him she and her boyfriend were taking a break. I told him I loved him, but if he wanted to take a break to see where things could go with another woman than I considered it a break up. I told him I wanted him to be happy, but I would not sit around and be a doormat and wait for him while he slept with someone else.I would accept decision, but if he didn't chose me we were done. He chose me and eventually phased her out of his life.\\n\\n\\nI have forgiven him. We met young and he didn't expect to meet someone he would be so serious with when he did. I do.understand that, but he still treated me pretty horribly and while I have tried to let it go completely, the hurt doe creep up from time to time because it was such a tough time for me and really hits a sensitive, insecure part of me.\\n\\nWe have a great life a d a great married. We even survived the loss of our oldest daughter six days after birth to trisomy 18. We have two other daughters (2.5 years old and 10 months old). I had to get a hysterectomy because of pain and issues. This has been hard on me. Now I am making ovarian cysts on the one ovary I have left. The pain, disappointment and fear is causing me a lot stress (and physical pain). I may need to have this ovary removed, which will put me into full menopause and I am only 29. I can't do hormone replacement and this could shorten my life by 20 years. As we are waiting to get my prescription for pain medication and finding out I have to call my gynocologist to figure this all out, my husband goes, \"oh, hey, it was L's birthday and she mentioned she is pregnant with a little boy.\" I know she has a daughter to. I just said that was nice and I hope it means her MS is under control. I meant it to because I don't wish her ill. MS is a terrible thing for anyone to go through and she was young, scared and looking for a better man. What she did was wrong, but desperate people do desperate things. I can let that go.\\n\\nNow to the heart of it all. It. Bothered me that he is Facebook friends with her and knows what is going on in her life. It bothers me that he mentioned her because it feels like he brought her into our lives, even though it was something small. I was feeling nervous and in pain and he had to bring her up. It was frustrating, but I know it wasn't something done to be cruel. He just saw it and mentioned it like he does with so many other things.\\n\\nI took the opportunity to try to talk with him about it last night. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but when it was fresh we couldn't talk about it without tears and so much pain. I was curious about a few things and asked if he would be comfortable talking about it with me. He adMota what he did in college was wrong. He hates he caused me so much pain and was ashamed he did that to me, but it was the past and he was over it. Now, I don't want him to feel bad and ashamed forever, but he basically told me it doesn't ever bother him anymore because he is a different man and that I helped make him that better man. I get that and appreciate that he feels that way, but it bother me a bit that he doesn't feel ashamed about it at all now. It still was him who caused me that pain. I also wanted to know what it was about her than made her worth hurting me, what made him chose her over me so many times. He claimed that's not what he was doing. I explained that by going out and spending time with her knowing it hurt me, he decided to put her above me, that he valued spending time with her more and I wanted to understand what made him feel she was more worth it than I was. He swears up and down it isn't like that. That he doesn't quantify relationships like that. I tried to explain that when he choses to do something he knew would hurt me in order to do something for someone else thst he wasn't putting me first. He chose to make the other person more important. He kept insisting things don't work that way. It felt like her wasn't trying to see things my way and understand why it hurt as much as it did and how that insecurity is still with me today. He just kept insisting thst it wasn't like that. I told him it felt like he was bringing her into our lives by mentioning her. I explained that I needed his love and support because of what is physically going in with me and mentioning someone who caused me so much pain really hurt me. He asked if I wanted him to unfriend her. I told him that I would never tell him who to associate with and that was his choice (and I mean that). It's not like I think he is going to have an affair with her or that he is having long conversations with her. That said, it does hurt that he still has allowed her to be in his life, even in this incredibly minor way, because of the past history. I tried explaining that it hurt because she was a reminder of the troughest point in our relationship. He went on a rant how he never sees or talks to anyone from college. His best friend from college, who was like a brother to him, died 8 years ago from lymphoma  (we were there for him the whole time). I know it hurts him he doesn't spend time with anyone else from school. We have talked about it in the past. That said, this is a person who tried to convince him to leave me for her. She actively perused him and while he didn't have a physical relationship she, what he done could be seen as an emotional affair. I feel like not having any form of contact wit h her is a given. Apparently not. Hell, if he insists on being her friends for whatever resson, don't talk about her to me, especially when I am suffering depression and anxiety and physical pain. I mean, if something bad happened to her and she needed help I would be more okay with that because she doesn't have a lot of support. But why tell me about her life? If I had someone like that in my past (I don't, because no matter how many people tried to peruse me in high school and college, and there were a few who tried, I never did anything like that to him) I would not have any contact with them at all. Hell, I avoided the guy who asked me to a school dance (in college) because he knew I had a boyfriend and was still clearly trying to make a move on me out of respect for our relationship. I don't want to tell him he can't talk to her at all. I do trust him. It just hurts thst he doesn't even understand why this hurts me. We usually communicate very well, but it feels like he refuses to fully listen and see why this hurts me. I finally got so frustrated I told him just to forget about it. He asked this morning if I am still upset over it and I told him that I am. I am working on letting it go, but it all really hurts me, especially that he can't understand why it hurts me so much.\\n\\n\\nSorry if this is long and confusing. I am.on my phone and was trying to type this out while one kid rested and the other was on the potty. \\n\\nAm I an asshole for being hurt that my husband mentioned someone who tried to steal him away in college is having another baby while we were leaving a difficult doctor's appointment?   \n",

Due to work, we currently live in different countries, even continents. I planned on visiting her but I hadn't gotten a visa yet.\\n\\nThere was a long weekend coming up, and this coworker asked me if I wanted to join her on a vacation. She said that there will be three of us if I join. I told my wife that I was going to join.\\n\\nNearing the long weekend, the third person said that he'll not be joining. I didn't tell my wife about it, thinking that it makes no difference.\\n\\nI still took the vacation. We stayed at a hotel, different rooms and all. Nothing happened other than enjoying the vacation, visiting the tourist sites etc.\\n\\nOn our way back, my wife asked me if I went to vacation just with that female coworker. I answered truthfully and she got mad, saying that I was inconsiderate of her feelings.\\n\\nAITA here?   \n",

Me, 22M, her, 20F.\\n\\nWe had a bit of a shouting match last night over getting the apartment cleaned up. I feel I shouldn't have to do as much as she's asking since I'm basically paying all the bills other than the internet/netflix bill, and I work 50+ hours a week.\\n\\nShe, consequently, only does nanny work occasionally as she can find it, so I only find it fair she should do most of the cleaning if she isn't working as often.\\n\\nI think I'm being pushed, when I'd expect her to do her fair share, considering I also do a lot of the dishes, vacuuming, laundry, etc. The least she can do is cook and clean if she isn't working.\\n\\nSo, who's the asshole here?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                         Alright, that title may have been misleading, but you're all only getting my side of the story here so I want to make sure I paint a very clear picture.\\n\\nFive and 1/2 years ago, I had a baby with a man that I married.  He was 19, I was 21.  He came from a family with very detached parents, I came from a loving, close-knit family.  We were very much the products of our upbringing.  We stayed together until she was ten months old.  During that ten months he was rarely around.  He would stay out until he knew I had her put to bed for the night.  He couldn't stand the sound of her crying, he would never allow himself to be left alone with her.  Looking back as an adult, it is very clear he was young, inexperienced and terrified.  At the time, I was also young and inexperienced, and didn't understand why he couldn't just love and spend time with our daughter.\\n\\nHe left when she was ten months old, letting me know that I could contact him for child support but he wasn't interested in raising this child.  Once he moved out, I didn't let him move back in, but when he came around feeling sorry for his actions, I wanted him to see our daughter so I allowed visits.\\n\\nAfter the first couple of visits, he started coming later and later and eventually began showing up after she was in bed.  When I realized he was visiting ME instead of HER, I put a stop to it.  He became angry and again told me that he didn't want to have anything to do with the child.\\n\\nThis time, I decided there were no take-backs.  From my point of view, I didn't want my daughter to deal with a father that was in-and-out of her life. By this time, she was only a year old, but eventually she would grow up and I never wanted her to hear her own father say outloud that he wanted nothing to do with her.\\n\\nWe went through the court for our divorce that year.  Having never actually been left alone with our daughter, he was given supervised visitation once/week through a facility in our county.  He attended the first few times and then just stopped showing up.  He didn't even show up to the last two divorce/custody hearings and they ended up finalizing it without him present.  \\n\\nNow my daughter is 5 and 1/2.  I've always been honest with her about the situation to an age-appropriate level.  (You used to have another daddy, but he knew he wasn't very good at being a daddy so he went away so that your life could be filled with love and joy.  Then it was just you and me for a while until we met _[my husband]__ and now he takes good care of you.)  She loves her step-dad, knows he isn't her biological father but she wants to call him Dad anyway.  She is happy and healthy and thriving.\\n\\nMy ex recently contacted me to ask if we could get together outside of court so he could get to know her.  I didn't even text him back.  As I said before, my child is happy and healthy and I don't want a sudden new daddy to fuck that up for her.  My theory is that since he chose when to leave, I'll let HER choose when they meet up.  I plan to give her the choice when she is older and I feel she is  mature enough.  \\n\\nWe come from a small town, he still talks to friends of friends of friends of mine.  Word has come back to me that people now thing I am this horrible bitch, witholding this poor man from seeing his daughter even when he is repenting for his actions.  \\n\\nI honestly don't even see him as \"the asshole\" except for the spreading of his pity party.  I see him as a troubled teen who got scared and couldn't handle the task of raising a child.  Up until now, I had actually been thankful to him that he made the choice to leave instead of making her early years harder.  \\n\\nSorry for the long post, but I feel it was all relevant to understand both sides.  AM I the asshole?   \n",

She told me that this was customary of her culture (she's from Hong Kong). I refused, arguing that it was bizarre and even inappropriate to do so in my culture, especially since I've never met her mother before.\\n\\nAll in all, it wasn't a huge deal. But am I an asshole for not calling my ex's mom, Auntie?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                             Okay so it's the custom at my school that the weekend after prom a group of friends rents a house by the shore and drinks, parties and conducts general debauchery. Prom is Saturday night and the bus for prom houses leave right after prom, and generally most people come back on the bus Tuesday night. \\n\\nAnyway, my group's prom house started forming around early October, when I submitted an initial deposit of $21 to the girl running it - let's call her Eileen. About a month later I met my current girlfriend and started dating her, problem is she wasn't from my town and people generally don't allow people who are juniors or out of town to come down to the prom houses. However there are instances where other people outside of the designated prom house come down for a bit. \\n\\nSo I submitted another deposit around January of $118 (although I actually gave her $120 because of ATM withdrawal) A little after this time my gf asked what we were gonna do after prom and I said I didn't know, she was kinda distraught that she wasn't going to be able to hang out with me after prom at all and I realized it was kinda fucked so at this point I told Eileen I'd go down Sunday morning (after spending Saturday night with gf) and I'd find a ride down to the shore house. I also needed to do a presentation Wednesday so I said I'd get a ride back late Monday night with one of the other people who are going back Monday night (there's lots). No problems there.\\n\\nFast forward to February, Eileen requests $118 ($120 again due to ATM withdrawal)again along with $70 for food and alcohol. She said this was the last payment and I was fine with that, albeit hesitant about paying that much for alcohol since I'm not a heavy drinker. \\n\\nWell, a few weeks ago, she says we need to pay $54 each for the bus. I figure I'd get a discounted rate since I'm only going from the pre-prom location to prom in the bus, the rest I'm gonna do myself. She told me nope and that it's $54 for both my girlfriend and I even though neither of us are taking the bus to the actual prom house (the extent of the cost). Now I was pretty upset about this not gonna lie. \\n\\nSo it's the week before prom and I got surgery Monday and the results came back that I can't drink at all this weekend so I asked Eileen to re-apportion my alcohol money to food instead. She said it was too late for that and I still needed to pay for the bus. The problem here is that the food we have is very minimal, only easy mac, ramen and various snacks and water. No burgers, no hot dogs, no nothing. Yet there are 28 people in the prom house and we gave her $70 EACH for alcohol AND food. Plus there's at least one other person who hasn't paid for the bus yet and he told me she hasn't said anything to him. He's also closer friends-wise with her, although when I brought it up she did say he would have to pay for the bus. But he's a heavy drinker and using the bus to get down to the shore house. Then she said if I refused to pay for the bus I would have to formally apologize in the Facebook group because she wouldn't have enough money to buy food that people want.\\n\\nAt this point I had an outburst because I said the food should have already been covered at this point and my bus money should have nothing to do with that, and that I'm already paying for alcohol which I won't be drinking, 3 nights for the house when I'll only be staying for 1; and now a bus I'd only use for a 15 minute ride from pre-prom to the actual prom event. \\n\\nOh also she suggested the idea of having her college Freshman friends come down to drink with us and then drive some people back Tuesday morning. This angered me too because she's cool with allowing them to come down whenever but not my significant other when I've deposited all this money already.\\n\\nAnyway Reddit I'll be happy to clarify anything for you to determine if I'm the asshole or not. Should I drive my date to prom in my car? Should I pay her and suck it up? Should I continue to insist my way on to the bus for 15 minutes without paying? \\n\\nEdit: Forgot this bit -  Apparently she did some mismanagement with money and some people gave her less than she had asked for in some cases but she never counted. If I'm supposed to feel bad for her fronting money because she didn't keep track of the expenses and the amount she was given - I don't. I'm not going to cover anyone else and I think it should be fair that I get to go to the bus for prom at least. She said at the start of all this it would be $220-230 per person for the house if we had 24 people; currently we have 28 and it was $236 per person for just the house.\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: oh and earlier in the year she told me stories about how she overcharged people for alcohol since she had a fake and it was easy.    \n",

                                         On mobile, apologies. Also throwaway, as he's a Redditor.\\n\\nAt a fast food place we get our food and a worker (maybe simple, very fat and with a fucked up grill) insisted we use an upside down highchair to put our baby's car seat on. We do it, start eating, need condiments, so I get up and accidentally run into the highchair. I would call what I did a nudge, it tips over and in a split second my husband grabs it by the handle, saving the baby from falling to the ground (at the time I was speechless, just impressed, but he's got damn good dad reflexes). I don't think the baby would have been hurt, but it would have been jarring. \\n\\nEveryone's frozen because of the clatter, and the first thing he does is call the woman a dumb ass, loudly, semi calmly. She's nearby and just stares at him. I'm calming the baby and he goes on, almost shouting, saying how she recommended that position and she's a dumb ass. I'm a quiet, nonconfrontational person, and I'm honestly a little horrified. \\n\\nThe manager comes over and he tells her what happened. I think she was apologetic but trying to get him to stop yelling. He demands to-go materials, and as he's getting them a bystander is staring. He says how ya doing maam and she says not great. I'm getting the kids together, haven't said a word. He's calling her a looky lou and now they're arguing. We leave, but after he exits he changed his mind and hours back in to spit at the looky lou's feet.\\n\\nWe get: the car and he asks how I feel, and I say I don't want him to be angry with me. Two years leak out of my eyes. He encouraged me to express my feelings, and I say I'm embarrassed and I feel bad for that woman. He does get angry at me and calls me a pussy. I say I don't understand his white hot anger, I never have. He says it feels like shit to not be understood, on top of me crying and putting up a wall between us.\\n\\nSo, am I the asshole? Thanks, that was cathartic.   \n",

 I was at a pay-by-the-hour pool with my boyfriend. it's $5 per hour to soak in a heated pool in a hotel catering to young hipsters and families with kids. the place makes their own beer and cider, and they sell pitchers for drinking in the pool. It's a small crowd today because its so hot, me and my guy, a group of friends playing and drinking beer, and a family with several small children swimming. We're all horse playing and chatting for about 45 min when a new couple comes in. they don't have drinks, they come over to the corner of the pool we had colonized and post up about five feet away reading a paper back out loud while soaking.\\n\\nbf and I have been practicing hand stands and somersaults, we hardly notice them. I go for another handstand and bf pushes me over, so I stand up and splash him. The splash goes a little wide and sprinkles the new couple. The girl says \"hey, we're reading\" I said sorry and directed another smaller splash more narrowly at my bf, honestly not nearing them at all, and she again speaks up, \"Hey, we have a book. We're reading a book.\" I said ok, stopped playing, and fumed for the next ten minutes until our time was up.    \n",

                                                          I live in a house that has two tenants. Me and my girlfriend upstairs. A woman and her 10 year old son downstairs. My landlord wants to install a new concrete patio in the backyard. That's cool except that means during construction the woman who lives downstairs will have to walk through my place to get to hers. (Our homes are connected, her entrance at the back, mine at the front).\\n\\nShe's a nice lady and her son is great so it really wouldn't be a huge deal except the construction is going to take three weeks. Also, her ex husband and mother come over quite a bit. I feel like having several people walk through my place whenever they have to come and go for three weeks is ridiculous. I'd be willing to put up with it for a couple days. She's also a waitress so she would be coming and going very different hours. (Late nights, early mornings etc..)\\n\\nThe landlords think I'm being unreasonable because she/they just have to walk through my living room and kitchen, not my bedroom. In their words, \"You'll suffer for a bit but then have a nice new patio in the long run.\"\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

family. I have more cousins than I can count, and as a result unfortunately many of us generally close in age have formed \"cliques\" in a way. It's not that I dislike my family, just that I have a whole lot of it and there are only so many hours in the week. \\n\\nSo around July last year my cousin tells me at a gathering she's getting married, and that she isn't sure if she will be able to invite everyone, because like I said before, huge family. I tell her just let me know and congratulations. \\n\\nFast forward to a couple months ago and I get my invitation. I notified her that I wouldn't be attending. Now I won't be going because of the following:\\n\\n1. I work a lot. Like, as in 6 days a week, usually 55-60 hours at the least. I work the day of her wedding and it's a long hike from work. \\n2. I wasn't given a guest +1 for the event, despite the fact that my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other as long as she's been seeing this guy. (Not that she moved fast or anything.)\\n3. My previously mentioned girlfriend works in the airline industry and I haven't seen her in about 10 days. She'll be flying back in on the evening of the wedding (which again she wasn't invited to.)\\n4. Her and I have never been particularly close. We're friends on Facebook and all but I don't even have her number. She's from one of the other \"cliques,\" I suppose. When she notified me I wouldn't be receiving a guest for the reception, she did so via Facebook message. \\n5. Her mom, who is my aunt, have a lot of bad blood. Long story I won't get into here. \\n\\nSo as soon as my mom and dad find out about the whole ordeal of me not going I'm an asshole and this is the reason us cousins aren't close, and blah blah blah. \\n\\nI'm not going either way, I just wanted this subs input.    \n",

My girlfriend keeps texting me about onsets of sadness from books she is reading, to stuff going on, and trying to have full on discussions. I can't afford this time to participate. \\n\\nI'm not super experienced on relationships, and I know it is my job to be supportive, but I honestly don't know what she wants. She's driving me fucking nuts! \\n\\nI'm trying to focus, and her acting needy is driving me crazy.   \n",

                                                          Sorry if this is to long. \\n\\nI have been with my Asian-american girlfriend for 3 years, when we first started dating I was a terrible student. I have met her mother and her older sister and we are in a long distance relationship (about 230 miles) I see her 1 or 2 times a month on average.  That's the basics out of the way. \\n\\nAfter a year of dating I asked to meet her dad, she said no way not until I have a college degree. I didn't think much of it at the time but as we dated I really started working hard to finish and graduate. I am now just under a year off of graduating with a degree in Public Relations and I asked her if we could sit down and talk about where each of us are at in school. How she feels about in the future possibly sharing an apartment (makes sense financially), and also me meeting her father. \\n\\nShe got angry and shot me down, saying that she wouldn't even talk to me about it. I have tried to bring it up a few times but each time she says no or acts like it is some sort of interrogation. I understand why she is worried about her dad but its been 3.5 years, he knows I exist, moving in makes financial sense but i'm not set in stone on that, and she wont even talk to me about school just gives me run about answers.  \\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting to sit down and start making long term plans/goals. I'm 24 and am in the starting process of really looking at the long term of my life. I want to either move forward in this relationship or start to loosen it up so I can enjoy my last year as a college kid. I do love her but I can't put time into something that isn't going anywhere anymore. \\n\\nThe catch is this weekend I am going to town to celebrate her birthday that was last week. Is it to assholeish to talk to her this weekend about it? To be clear I do want to be with her and she is one of the few people I could see a future with...but I can't be with her if she wont communicate or doesn't have the same long term goals as me. \\n\\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for wanting to talk to my girlfriend about plans for the future on her birthday weekend even though she refuses to talk about it? \\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses, I have decided to lay off meeting the parents as that may be a cultural thing that I just don't grasp. I'm going to work on communication and if she truly doesn't want to talk then I will have to start thinking that this relationship isn't going anywhere.  Thanks so much for the responses I think I found one of my new favorite subreddits!    \n",

state a while back. I knew nobody and ended up getting a new job at a resturaunt full of awesome people. 3 of those people became my best friends and one of them is my current girlfriend. The other two are also a long time couple. Today, my best friend rob, told me he was irritable because of new meds he's on. We are usually very blunt and humorous with eachother. At this point in the night, I started making clown horn noises (see tig notaro). Rob didn't like that. So I kept doing it. So often in fact, that rob began getting extremely annoyed. He told me to stop. I kept doing it throughout the night (scattered of course) and by the time it was coming to an end I started to see his \"I'm so angry I'm smiling\" face and cut it out. Said goodbye,  forgot about it until I got home. We have a Facebook group and we started taking there (Settling an argument about wether a certain piece of furniture is an armoire or a cabinet). Anyways, the clown horn topic got brought up and Rob and Annelise both seemed pretty upset by it. At one point my girlfriend said \"let's just be friends\", and \"were best friends\", both to be followed by \"nah, what donald (me) was doing is being a shitty friend\" and \"nah, I'm out\". I can't stop thinking about it and it's really bothering me. I can never seem to hold friendships for longer than a few months but I truly hoped this would be different as I really like these people. I thought it was a harmless joke. Am I the asshole?\\n\\nTl;Dr Made clown horn noises all night after my friend told me to stop... Really irritated him. AITAO?   \n",

        This woman has been nothing but horrible to me all 13 years I have been with her son. She recently had a big fight with him after she offered to take the girls for a couple of hours so we could do lunch together on my birthday and then cancelled the next day because she had plans (which apparently is going somewhere to pick out plants, and that can't wait another minute). She is always disrespectful to me, claims we use her grandchildren against her (we never have, no matter how much she angers me, she doesn't see them because she doesn't make the time).\\n\\nMy husband expects me to go downstairs, smile and accept a birthday gift from her after she has been talking shit about me all week. I am not supposed to know about any of it, but even if I didn't, she has been incredibly rude to me for a long time. I don't want to put up with her. I really don't have it in me when she has been so awful, especially lately. She wants to see the kids, fine. I don't even want her into my house. I don't want a damn thing from her. \\n\\nTo top it all off, I am experiencing vertigo for the first time in my life. I don't have the ability to handle her right now. I usually shut up and just put up with her, but I think it is pretty unfair of him allowing her here today. Now we have to wait for her to come before we can do anything else. I have to deal with her as long as she wants to be here. I am very upset over it and my husband won't even hear me out. He told me to be a big girl and suck it up. I have been doing that for 13 years. I am at my wit's end with this woman. \\n\\nI am a complete asshole for not wanting to go and play nice while she is here? She is always rude to me, and yet I am the immature one for not wanting her to be near me on this one day.    \n",

                            IS it wrong that I'm obeying my parents and not pushing that they let me go for the day? \\n\\nWe planned on going to disneyland 2 days before I move and I have/can do a a lot of packing before we leave so that my family doesn't have to do any extra work., yet my parents insist I cant go.\\n\\nIt's our 3 year anniversary and we've been planning to go for a long time now; my girlfriend didn't take the news well. I really want to go but I don't want to go against my parents.\\n\\nSo basically are my parents, my girlfriend, or I the asshole?   \n",

sub-par posting and formatting skills. I'm a long time lurker and hope I can get some honest advice. \\nTo give a little background my boyfriend and I just graduated high school together and have been with each other for about a year now. He's always been pretty against me going to parties or touching anything other than weed(I smoke regularly and since our relationship has gone on hes gotten quite into it himself.) And I've done my best to respect that and have bitten my tongue countless times because he's told me \"I can't\" go do things or be around certain people because he doesn't approve for some reason, or he's jealous of them. I've tried acid and shrooms once and have experimented with painkillers and alcohol pretty heavily in the past. I ended up getting arrested and really saw my life for what it was, moved hours away, quit drinking and experimenting, mended my bad relationships with my family, graduated a year early, and am enrolled in college next semester. I'm so much happier with myself and don't really see the need to try other things that I know will harm my body becuase theres more to life than getting fucked up. Hes told me in the past that he's not comfortable with the drugs ive done and that he would break up with me without a  second thought if I ever touched cocaine or acid, which I think is pretty reasonable. I don't exactly want him into those things either. He's recently found a new group of friends and says he doesn't want me around them because, they're \"not accepting people\" and even had a birthday party that he didn't tell me about or invite me to with all of them the other day. A few daya ago he told me that he wanted to try cocaine and that we should do it together. I am not comfortable with cocaine at all and told him that. He says his friends were on it a few days before and they just looked so happy. I said I wasn't really comfortable with his friends doing cocaine around him. Last night he was staying over and his friend called him and asked him to come try cocaine, this made me very uncomfortable and I said \"I'm not sure if I like your friends, they seem like bad influences on you and I know you'd tell me the same thing. I'm just not comfortable with it.\" He starts to ignore me even being in the room until he finally tells me that I way too judgmental and that he's not staying at my house. I offered to let him sleep in my bed and I'd go on the couch and we could drop the situation right now. I beg him to just talk to me about it while he literally completely ignores my presence until saying that \"talking never works\" and things to that nature. I tried to stress that communication is pretty much the most important thing in a relationship and that we obviously need to talk about this problem. I said what I said because I'm not comfortable with hard drugs and feel like he's choosing his friends over me not because I'm trying to be judgemental. He then left with the friends that called him and probably did cocaine. \\nTL;DR boyfriend who was against drugs gets a call and decides he wants to go do cocaine. That's a little shady and I say that. I'm mean and judgmental and should beg him to come back.    \n",

He grabbed my girlfriends cousin ass, then her ass. My girlfriend told him to stop, but he still often does it and they still often hangout. She say's that I need to calm down because they're just \"friends\"\\n\\nI told her that I don't want her to hangout with this guy and she got mad at me and said I'm an asshole for not allowing her to hangout with her friend. Am I the asshole for not wanting her to hangout with who she wants?   \n",

the 2nd floor of an apartment building. My neighbor is very clean. She sweeps and mops outside around her door like weekly... Me... not so much... I have 3 girls. 6,5 and 3. I do try to be respectful by keeping it on the opposite side of our door so it's not on her side and we don't do it often. Like not even once a month. The girls did it last night while my husband and I cleaned up dinner and they did go a little crazy. The whole sidewalk was decorated. Well at least us and up to 3 doors down.... She got all nasty and was out there with buckets scrubbing the sidewalk just now.... I don't really think I'm being that big of a douche. It was raining all day and they needed to get outside. And it is just chalk and doesn't happen often. What do you think reddit?   \n",

sorry for the wall of text, but there is a lot of detail in this.\\n\\nI was at a concert, and if you've ever been to a metal venue, you'll know the majority of them are not seated. It's a big open floor with a barrier up front. You can't reserve a spot anywhere. If you leave your spot, you do not get it back if you change your mind.\\n\\n This was an all day festival (Summer Slaughter 2014) and my girlfriend and I had spent a pretty long time trying to get a spot up front at the barrier. We got up there just in time for the headliner, and the woman next to me was *very* drunk. She spent the entirety of the previous set jabbing her elbow into my rib cage (issue number 1). As soon as the final set started, she tried grinding on every guy around us, and grabbing at all of our crotches (issue number 2).\\n\\nSuddenly she turns around and leaves, someone else takes her place against the barrier, so we thought we were done dealing with her. A little while later, she decides she wants her spot back, so she comes back up, puts her hands on the barrier on either side of my girlfriend, and squeezes as hard as she can (issue number 3). I offered to switch places with my girlfriend so she could enjoy the show, but she said she'd rather be squeezed than have some random drunk chick grabbing my johnson. Fair enough. My girlfriend is not a big girl (5'2, 115 pounds) and she was clearly in a lot of pain. \\n\\nI tried asking a security guard for some help, but during the headliner of the show they were too busy catching crowd surfers to notice.\\n\\nTo solve this, I would throw my head in her direction while headbanging, hoping a face full of sweaty hair would make her want to leave. When it didn't, I forcibly pulled her hands off of the barrier and away from my girlfriend. When she kept putting her hands there and trying to squeeze the life out of my girlfriend, I turned around and screamed \"There is no room for you. Leave.\" in her face. She then turns to my girlfriend and asks if she wants to go outside to fight her (issue number 4). \\n\\nI again looked for security guards to help, but they were still all too busy.\\n\\nEventually, I'm tired of all of this. Being groped, jabbed with her elbows, her hurting my girlfriend, asking her to fight, and continuing to do this even though I, and everyone else around me, had told her to stop and that there just wasn't enough room for her, especially considering that *she* was the one that decided to give up her spot, and *we weren't even the ones that took her spot*. So the next time I turned around, I \"accidentally* elbowed her in the nose. \\n\\nShe still continued doing what she was doing, until finally a security guard caught on to what was happening, and pulled her off the floor.\\n\\nWas what I did going too far?   \n",

                                        My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year now, most of which has been long distance because she is in the UK for her MA, and I'm in North America (she's from the same city as I am, and will be returning here in a couple months permanently).\\n\\nAnyway, to the situation at hand. My girlfriend's parents and sister are currently visiting her in the UK, and will be there for 2 weeks. The problem is that my girlfriend feels that she should not be on her phone talking to me while her family is there, since it would be rude to them. I completely agree with that sentiment, because it would be rude to ignore her family like that. However, her family is staying at a hotel about 15 minutes by bus away from my girlfriend's apartment, so my gf and her sister have to take a bus there and back every day. In her city, the buses have wifi on them, so I asked her if she could talk to me while she is on those buses every day. But she said that would be rude to her sister (who is staying at her apartment instead of the hotel), so she can't. She asked one of her friends, as well as her parents and her sister, and they all agreed with her. Basically, they are all saying that I should trust her enough to let her not talk to me for the next 2 weeks.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting her to talk to me? Should I just let her not talk to me for the two weeks to appease her and her family/ friends? I really think that her talking to me on the bus isn't that big of a deal - it's not like I'm asking her to ignore her family all day.   \n",

                                      Hey guys, my first post, so here goes nothing:\\n\\nThis happened this morning, just a few minutes ago.\\n\\nI was on my way to work, stopped at the convenience store on the other side of the parking lot from work, and my girlfriend (who also works with me) came with.  On our way over a coworker, we'll call her Bethany, got my girlfriend's attention and asked about trivial stuff while I paced ahead of them, not wanting to get involved.  When my GF told me to slow down because I was walking too fast, I told her (loud enough that she could hear me, about 20 feet away) that she was talking to Bethany and I \"didn't want to have anything to do with that.\"  My girlfriend knows the past stuff that has gone on between Bethany and I, and knows that I do not like this person.\\n\\nAnyway, I went into the convenience store and Bethany followed us in.  I think she came up to me first, came behind me while I was at the counter, and said, \"That was highly inappropriate,\"  I said back, \"Well I'm not going to be rude to you at work, but outside of work...\"  I believe it was then that she came up to my girlfriend and said that, \"You better tell your girl that if I ever hear my name pass her lips again, I'm going to fucking kill her.\"\\n\\nNow, my GF and I sat down for a little while, eating our breakfast sandwiches that we bought, and she told me that, \"Sometimes the things I say are so embarassing.\"  This is when she told me that Bethany had threatened my life.\\n\\nLet me give you a little back story, so you know the context.\\n\\nI've been working here for about a year, and the first cubicle I was assigned to I sat immediately behind Bethany.  I knew who she was because I had seen her on the bus before (gotta love mass transit, right?) and I tried to become friends with her, since that's always my reaction to meeting new people.  She would have good days and bad days, and to be honest, my humor tends towards dry sarcasm.  Everyone else that I interract with at work gets the same, but only she seems to take it personally.  The incident that prompted her first threat against me was very mild, I thought.\\n\\nWe have a rule at work that cell phones are not to be out and used.  If a supervisor sees you with a cell phone then they will pass that along to your supervisor and then they will possibly take disciplinary action against you.  On this particular day, I had gotten up to use the bathroom and on my way back she startled hard, because she was on her phone and scared that it might be a Sup and not a coworker who had seen her breaking the rules. I appologized for startling her, and sat down and went back to work.  The next time it happened again.  This time, as I passed her and she freaked out, I said that maybe if she didn't have her cell phone out, she wouldn't be so startled by people walking past her.  When I sat down she said, very quietly, that she would beat me up after work.\\n\\nShe didn't.  But ever since that day I have actively tried to avoid being in the same place at the same time.  Obviously sometimes, like this morning, it is unavoidable.\\n\\nI brought this to the attention of my union, but the entire thing still makes me think that I may have somehow overreacted when I said, within earshot of Bethany, that I didn't want to have anything to do with her.  Should I have been more meek about this?\\n\\nTL;DR: Coworker that has a history of threatening me took it to the max this morning when she told my girlfriend (who was with me) that she would \"fucking kill me\".  This was right after I had said to my girlfriend (within earshot of this coworker) that I didn't want to have anything to do with the conversation she and this coworker were having together.  Happened off work property, though, so AITA?   \n",

                                                   My boyfriend and I (both in our mid-twenties) were very much looking forward to playing each other in a game of basketball. If it's important for me to describe \"both sides in detail,\" I have to mention that he and I hadn't had the same afternoon off in quite a while and I'd been asking him to ball with me for over a year!\\n\\nThe local park near his new apartment was the perfect spot for a game. Public pool, HUGE playground and jungle gym, soccer field, and a full covered, regulation sized basketball court. \"Wanna warm up with a game of horse?\" I ask. He agrees, and we start shooting, running, and rebounding. We keep it half court, because a 50-something father and his teenage children had started a two-on-two game of their own on the other side.\\n\\nBy the time my bf accumulates an H, O, and R (I had less; ball is life), a tall 30-something father walks into the court area, straight towards our basket with his two sons. The older son could not have been more than FIVE years old. His younger brother, still all bald-headed with his natal-headed self, could not have been more than TWO years old. My boyfriend and I stop, double take both each other and the scene as the dad says to his children \"Go ahead, guys. Take some shots.\" It takes the 5YO attempting two or three shots with a MINIATURE foam basketball that fail to reach even two feet below the REGULATION SIZED basket for my boyfriend and I to dribble around the three point line whispering to each other \"What do we do?\" The dad registers our reaction and calls out \"Hey guys, you can keep shooting!\" Sure, sir. Can't wait to see how you react if one of our shots accidentally bricks off the hoop and slams into your tiny child's tiny child mouth. We try to take shots, and it's impossible. The kids are up against the basket (still 0 PPG by my count), and we feel uncomfortable playing at our previous, desired speed. \\nCool dad sees us again discussing our options on the sidelines (which, I'll be honest, was me hissing at my boyfriend to not let the dad hear our laments outloud), and he says \"Y'all can keep going! We didn't mean to interrupt anything!\" The bf and I are not combative people, so after less than 10 minutes of total game play, he and I leave the park and walk back home.\\n\\nOne the walk back home he and I furiously threw out sentences to pinpoint why we felt so shitty about what just happened. \"In any neighborhood basketball court ANYwhere, dibs are dibs.\" \"Agism? He didn't try interrupting the OTHER family's game. Would he have done that if we were both grown men?\" \"What were we gonna do? Call out this dude in front of his children?\" \"THE FUCK ARE CHILDREN GONNA DO ON REGULATION SIZED SHIT?!\" We agreed the appropriate response could have been \"Sir, we were in the middle of a game. Would you like us to give you ten or so minutes to shoot around?\" but Are We the young childless Assholes for getting so angry at Cool Dad?    \n",

I then got dumped for my best mate and lied to for 8 months until a friend of hers told me. I offered to pay her back when we broke up and she said not to worry about it. We paid for each other's stuff all the time and consider it even. Three years later, last weekend, we were at the friends birthday and she tells me that I still owe her the money. Am I the asshole for not paying her back?    \n",

Since he's gotten back he hasn't really done anything as far as being a productive member of society.  He lived with my girlfriend and I for a few month when he got back.  During the time he lived with me he did nothing to get a job or find a place to live.  He bought groceries but complained that I wanted 300/month for rent so I didn't charge him rent.  \\n\\n  I guess he felt that he was no longer welcome because he moved in with a mutual friend who also was charging 300/month for rent but my brother actually pays him. Since then he hasn't really done a whole lot beyond drinking.  He has plenty of money as we both got a good chunk of change when my mom passed away two years ago.  I chose to take less money in exchange for her house, which my brother agreed too so I bought his half of the house from the will.  \\n\\n  So literally he has three bills a month to pay.  Cellphone bill, Car insurance and rent.  He neglected to pay his car insurance for some amount of time and his insurance company reported it to the state who in turn revoked the registration on his car for 3 months.  Now he has to turn the plates to his car in and where he lives can only park it on a public road where it will get towed without the plates on it. The most aggravating part about this is when I talked to him, he blames the insurance company.  I asked him how it was anyone's fault but his own and got no reply. My girlfriend and I both don't want to let him park his car here for 3 months.  \\n\\n  I feel like he needs to get his shit together and be responsible human being and that I also shouldn't have to be responsible for his life decisions. I have tried to do what I can for him but if he continues to chose not to do anything productive or be responsible for his own actions, I cannot continue to make his issues my issues.   \n",

                                       My daughter is having her Pre-K graduation in about a month. My wife said that she might cry at it. I mentioned that it is not a big deal to me, because she will still be going for a few weeks after it, and the big deal is her starting kindergarten. My wife said that it will be a big deal to our daughter. I told my wife that we will treat it like a big deal for her, but that I won't think it is. My wife sees it as a big progression, and I see it as a step. Am I the asshole for not thinking Pre-K graduation is a big deal?    \n",

high school but are doing long distance in college.\\n\\nEver since the summer after we graduated from high school, our larger group of friends have taken an annual camping trip. I've attended every year, this will be our third trip. The first trip my girlfriend didn't go and experienced quite a bit of FOMO syndrome. The second year she ended up joining us but she doesn't like a couple of people and wasn't catered to as much as she'd like (she's a picky eater and there were no showers) so she had a pretty negative time. This year she decided not to go because she had a bad time last year.\\n\\nWe just got in an argument because she was under the impression I wasn't going again this year. She tells me that she feels as if I'm choosing our friends over her by going on this 3 day camping trip. I've already committed to going since she never told me that she didn't want me to. I'm feeling resentful that she's telling me this now when I still want to go have a good time with friends and would feel awkward backing out a day before the we leave to go camping.\\n\\nI'd be happy to provide more details or background info in the comments if you guys ask. I just am feeling very conflicted because she's been crying for half an hour now. I feel attacked but she's acting like the victim so I'm genuinely not sure who is the asshole. Help me out, tell me how to proceed?   \n",

     So my boyfriend, Frank, and I drove down for his best friend's birthday celebrations.  I genuinely like the best friend, he's my favorite of Frank's buddies. Let's call him Mike.\\n\\nMike was pretty ambivalent about his birthday, was down to do whatever. He was open to suggestions and we all kept making him choose things like dinner locations and such. \\n\\nFor this birthday, after dinner and cake, he wanted us all to do an improv acting game. \\nIt was pretty much doing improved reenactments of stories friends told. Nobody in the group (all of which were people I hadn't met prior to today) besides Frank and Mike have ever done improv classes or shown interest in being in theatre. \\nI felt collective discomfort with how the group wasn't into doing scenes, some were quite vocal about it. We all did it anyway. I wanted to be supportive of what Mike wanted to do but at the same time felt like it was tune death to having fun. \\n\\nThis was seriously the only thing he wanted to do so I felt extra bad for feeling so negative. I tried really hard to be a good sport but at the same time was getting really annoyed with this being pushed on me. I stayed quiet for most of it. \\n\\nI'm probably more bothered by this than usual because when Frank and I hang with Mike, we usually end up doing improved skits and plays they write on the spot. \\nIt's just not my cup of tea. \\n\\nBut then again, it's the guy's birthday and the only real thing he wanted to do! Is it really bad that I was a spoilsport? Apparently with how bad at acting and improv, it probably wasn't very hard to figure out I wasn't having a good time.\\n\\nHappy to provide more details if needed! \\nSo AITA? Thanks for any input.\\n\\nEdit: If it helps with context, we are all recent college grads. \\n   \n",

                                                        Me and my girlfriend are going into junior year of high school next year and we got news that she will have to wear a neck brace all next year. We have been dating for a year and 2 months, and the neck brace is not her only medical problem. She has these terrible muscle spasms and get weak after walking a small amount and will need to sit down.  (she is not over weight btw) Our problems did not star until around the 11 month mark and no medical news was know at that time. We have argued alot over the past few months and im starting to not like to talk to her and see her as much, so if you were thinking im thinking about breaking up because of the medical problems you're wrong. She is also going to a different school next year but still living in the same house, she lives close to me, about 5 min away. I feel as tho if i did break up with her it would make me seem like a terrible person. I was still planning on being her friend but as selfish as this sounds, i don't want to deal with her anymore on a boyfriend level. I'm not sure if im being an asshole or not. We are both not getting along as well   \n",

                                                                                                                                                               So last night I was out at a bar with my girlfriend, had a couple of drinks but nothing crazy. To set the stage this bar is very small, there's a bar down the one side (like the physical bar with the Taps and bar stools), a small one person wide lane to walk through, and two person tables along the wall. Pretty tight space, and so seating is at a premium. \\n\\nTowards the end of the night we were ready to go and my girlfriend went to the washroom while I got up to pay the bill. We both left our coats on the backs of our chairs, and our empty glasses were on the table. \\n\\nI come back from paying the tab and my chair is gone and my coat has been thrown (or placed nicely, I don't know I wasn't there) onto the table. The table behind us now has a third chair, with a new person sitting in it. Presumably the friend of the people already sitting there. \\n\\nNow, we were leaving at this point anyways but I was annoyed that my coat had been moved and the chair had been taken, because it could have been just as likely that I had gone to get another drink instead of paying to leave. (bar service only) so I got the guys attention and told him that I happened to be leaving but in the future he probably shouldn't take chairs that have coats on them because they're clearly taken. He tried to give the chair back, and I told him not to worry about it because I didn't need it anymore I was leaving, just that he probably shouldn't take chairs from tables that are clearly in use. He then told me that if I didn't want the chair back that I should have just left him alone, and that I was being an asshole. \\n\\nI didn't want to start a confrontation so I just told him to be sure next time, at which point he flipped me off so I blew him a kiss. At that point I left with my girlfriend and he yelled at her that her boyfriend was an asshole. \\n\\nMaybe I didn't need to say anything, but I still think he needed to know it's not cool to just move the belongings of strangers to get a chair. Maybe I'm the asshole?   \n",

     I am going out of my mind!  I'm so sick of being in my house, my town, my state.  I haven't been on any kind of a vacation since May, and I'm going stir crazy. \\n\\nWe like to try to go somewhere every three months, but he can't get time off from work to go to the lake next week.  I want to take my daughter, her friend, and my mother.  My husband thinks I'm being an ass to go without him.\\n\\nThe thing is, he's going out of town on business the second week of August, and then again the third week of August.  I realize a business trip is not as fun as a family vacation, but it's still getting out of town and going somewhere.\\n\\nIf I don't go next week, because of my daughter going to school, my next vacation won't be until we go to Cancun in December.  And I don't know if I can last that long.\\n\\nSo, am I being an ass for wanting to go without him?  I get that he wants to go and share in the fun...  but if he can't go is it fair that none of us get to?   \n",

                                               This ended up fairly long but there is a TL;DR. If anything is unclear please let me know and I'll try to clarify.\\n\\nI am 23 years old, recently graduated from college, and currently living with my mother on the East Coast (USA). If it matters my parents are divorced and I am not living under my father's roof. Recently my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together in California. This is a good move for me career-wise because I want to work in the biotech/pharma industry.\\n\\nI ask my father for advice frequently but he also gives a lot of unsolicited advice. He says that this is because he has an analytical problem-solving nature that he can't shut off. He  thinks that I need to have interviews lined up in CA before moving there, otherwise I will drain my savings.\\n\\nIdeally I'd love to have interviews lined up before moving but I personally don't think it's realistic. Companies often don't take applicants seriously if their address is on the other side of the country. I did apply to a lot of CA jobs during spring and never heard back from any of them. I was afraid that if I applied to more with my East Coast address it would be a waste. My father then suggested I put down an address of someone I know in CA, but I'd have to be able to fly down for interviews on short notice, which would also drain my savings.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I picked out a short-term lease apartment and he is willing to cover rent and other costs of living until I am employed. We made a budget. I have $8000 in savings that will be used on the security deposit and my plane ticket. The rest will be emergency funds. I do not expect my father to bail me out financially under any circumstances. I am not moving to CA for around a month, but I have started applying to jobs using the apartment's address. My father wanted me to have interviews lined up before choosing an apartment.\\n\\nI fully explained my reasoning to my father and I can explain more of my reasoning if anyone asks. I do understand my father's concerns and I know he's trying to look out for me. I told him that I took time to think on his advice but I am not going to follow it and I would like to stop discussing it. He got angry and told me that was a very disrespectful thing for me to say.\\n\\nMy father thinks I was just too lazy to apply for jobs early because people in my generation have lazy attitudes. He said he felt it was his duty to \"slap that attitude in the face\". I found this very hurtful because I'd applied to tons of East Coast jobs before deciding to move to CA, so I'm clearly not too lazy to apply to jobs. At this point both of us were raising our voices. \\n\\nAt 9:40 during the argument I told him I needed to leave soon to feed cats I was pet sitting by 10:00. He wouldn't drop the argument and I reminded him I needed to leave several times. The cats have special diets and need medicine, so by 10:40 I walked away from the argument, telling him I was already 40 minutes late to feed them. This is especially where I'm worried I was the asshole. But in my opinion it's definitely an asshole move to not feed the cats.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I told my father that when he gives me unsolicited advice I will always listen and consider it. But if I end up choosing not to follow his advice I want him to respect my decision. His response was that this is very disrespectful to him. I ended up walking out mid-argument because I was pet sitting cats with special dietary needs and was already 40 minutes late to feed them. My father was aware that I had this responsibility. I am 23, not living under my father's roof, and not depending on him financially. AITA for choosing not to follow his advice and/or leaving the argument to feed the cats?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                               My boyfriend rented out a room in his house to his best friend \"John\" and John's girlfriend \"Anna\". John and my boyfriend work away from home frequently, so it was mostly me and Anna. The house belongs to my boyfriend and we all paid the same rent.\\n\\nAnna was not cut out for roommates. She left huge messes all over the house (dirty sports equipment, clothing) and would render shared spaces unusable for hours (using the living room to Skype her family, taking 2 hours in the bathroom when everybody else was getting ready for work). She also had it out for me. If I so much as left a dish in the sink, she would call my boyfriend to tattle on me. She would get mad at me for not washing the dishes she used to cook herself a 4-course meal and thought I wasn't \"doing my share\". I cooked my own food and washed my own dishes...\\n\\nEventually, I told Anna to chill out and stop complaining. She was the only person who ever complained, out of four people sharing the house. She did not take kindly to this and decided that she and John were moving out ASAP.\\n\\nShe and John moved out while my boyfriend and I were on vacation. I cleaned the entire house before we left, and when I got back the house was a disaster. There was garbage all over the floor, molasses spills on the hardwood and they had taken all of our toilet paper, so I couldn't even pee at home after a 15 hour plane ride at 1am. They had also left dirty dishes PILED in the sink and the garbage can overflowing onto the floor.\\n\\nMy boyfriend was off at work and didn't have to clean the mess (I did). He also decided that John could continue to use our garage and shed as a storage space (even though they don't pay rent and have their own garage, but that's none of my business). John and Anna kept one of our house keys so they could access the house where the garage key is kept.\\n\\nAnna is over at the house at *least* every two weeks, and she only comes when the house is empty. The first time, she let my puppy escape the house. He was 12 weeks old and 1.5lbs. The second time, beer cans spilled from her trunk and she left them there in the yard. Then yesterday, she gave the house key to her brother and told him to pick up her golf equipment. I got home and the driveway was blocked by him, so I had to park on a different street than where I live. \\n\\nI asked my boyfriend to either take the key back, or tell Anna that she can only come over when I am home. I said I knew it was his house, but I lived there too and I felt uncomfortable with Anna having unlimited access to my possessions and pet because she had proved that she doesn't respect the space. She was also handing the keys around to other people and every time she came, she caused a huge inconvenience (cleaning up after her, not having a place to park, MY DOG ALMOST GETTING AWAY).\\n\\nBoy, did that go over poorly. My boyfriend told me \"It's his house and he trusts his friends\". I said he shouldn't, because she almost got our dog killed and I have to clean up every time she comes over. He said \"This is how it is, I'm not changing anything just because you complain. My house, my rules. Get over it. I'm not going to tell my best friend that I don't trust him\".\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not wanting disrespectful people coming in and out of where I live willy-nilly? I just want them to be more considerate if they're going to use all the available storage space for free...   \n",

very often. Our conversation wa salways the same, GUYS. I am a girl who is not blown away by guys, but she is somebody who has been single her entire life, because she has very bad luck in love, like awful bad luck, even though she goes after the guys, not shy at all. anyways, besides that, we have nothing in common, and this made me feel very distant, but I was her best friend. Finally, I decided to cut the relationship, because I told her i like a friend of hers, and after two days she way \"just joking\" telling him to be boyfriend and girlfriend.She begged me sorry and i said ok, but never talked her again. she did a couple of times and I answered, but that was it. Last weekend I went to see the band, and I felt so good because she was not with me stalking guys. I told her that and she made a show, she said I was such a bad person, and blocked me from everywhere, PLUS, she wrote in a fb group with unknown people that I was mean to her. AM I THE ASSHOLE?   \n",

better posts, and because this incident caused an absolutely gigantic fight...\\n\\nLast winter, my sister came to visit from out of town. The bus she usually takes normally arrives a little after midnight. In the past, either myself, or more typically my husband, go to pick her up. The bus depot is only a fifteen minute walk from my home, but since it's late at night, we don't like her walking alone. We've done this maybe 7 or 8 times prior.\\n\\nOn the night in question, a few things were different. First, my husband and I were both very ill with a cold, and we were both taking Nyquil/Sudafed/whatever we could find. Second, a blizzard had made the roads very treacherous, and we hadn't yet had the opportunity to put the winter tires on the truck. Because I found it unsafe and unwise for either of us to drive tired, sick, on drugs, during a blizzard, I texted my sister earlier that evening and asked if she would please take a cab instead. She said no problem.\\n\\nCue my mother calling me ten minutes later in an absolute fury. She accuses my husband and I of being horribly selfish and cruel for leaving my sister alone at the bus depot when we could so easily drive and get her. I explained my position and reasoning, but she was livid and wanted to hear none of it. I asked what damn business was it of hers, when this entire exchange was between my sister and I to begin with. This... did not help defuse the situation.\\n\\nThe conversation devolved into a screaming match and we ceased speaking to one another for some days. When my sister found out, she was shocked, and felt very torn between my mother and I.\\n\\nWe've since smoothed things over, but my mother still maintains her position, and I believe I was correct.\\n\\nSo, who (if anyone) was the asshole?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        First I want to list the people that are involved in this situation. First off there's the main girl we'll call her M (I will also refer to M and \"her\") then there is the guy we'll call him D(I will also refer to D as \"him\"), there is another girl that I had a thing with we'll call her H, my ex is also apart of this story we'll call her S, and of course me. We are all in high school although D is a grade higher than me and M. M and I have been friends for about 6 months now and I have grown to like her a lot. We have similar personalities and have gone through a lot of the same shit in life, making it very easy for her and I to sympathize with each other on most everything.\\n\\nIn the beginning of our friendship I was talking to and pursuing H, I had no idea that M might like me at all. Eventually the thing with H fell through. After it fell through I had a conversation with M, where I learned that M liked me before she knew I had a thing with H, she then told me that she no longer liked me and had moved on. After this I started dating S and M started to have a thing with D, I was happy in my relationship and I was happy for her.\\n\\nLong story short I broke up with S and decided that I was done with relationships for awhile. I was still happy for M and D they never officially started dating but they were happy together and what did I care. As school ended and summer began M and I were talking and Skyping a lot, during these conversations we grew very close. I learned that her best friend and her were having a fight and weren't really talking. So in away I became her person she talk to. \\n\\nIn the middle of summer M and D hadn't gone on a signal date or seen each other, the last time they had seen each other was the last day of school. M had told me that she wasn't really interested in dating D and only wanted to be good friends with D but didn't want to push D away so she said nothing to him about being just friends. So at this point I thought that they weren't dating and that she didn't like him. One day we were texting and she mentioned that she had just had an amazing day with D at a local theme park, I guess this \"date\" had changed her feelings for him. I started to ask questions about her day and what it was like. What I found out is that M and D aren't officially \"dating\" but they have a \"thing\" whatever that means. \\n\\nThe next day we were Skyping and I told her that I liked her and that I have feelings for her, M told me that she likes me as well but she also likes D at the same time, she said that she knows that its a bad thing to feel and that it wasn't fair to either me or D. We continue our conversation like nothing happened. In other Skype conversations I tried to bring up the whole topic of her liking me and D, but most of the time she would avoid the question or talk about something else. The one time that I did get her to talk about it was when she listed the pros and cons of both me and D. Both me and D had about the same Pros (She says that we're very similar, I don't know him to well), my one con was that I wasn't in her friend group and D's one con was that he was a year older than her. Neither of these cons being that bad.\\n\\nMoving this long story up to just a few days ago. While I was texting her she seemed kinda out of it and wasn't really in the conversation, if that makes any sense. Anyways I asked her what was on her mind and she replied with a wall of text. This wall of text basically said that M was feeling pathetic because she can't face anything coming towards her (I'm assuming she meant the situation with me and D) M also said that I really likes D but he tries to fix everything and be her shrink but all she wants him to do is to listen but she doesn't think he capable of just listening. She went on and said \"And you, oh you are just, basically perfect, and that's actually really annoying because I want to just like D and be done with it but I can't because when I talk to you it reminds me of what he isn't. And I hate that. I really don't like it. But it's there. And I don't know what to do with it. And I feel awful for feeling that, because it's not fair to either of you.\" Honestly, I don't know what to take from this part of the text, but now you're caught up to present day, My question is am I the asshole For wanting her to be with me and just go up to her and ask her to be my girlfriend and not be with D ?  Feed back and questions are welcome.\\n\\nTLDR: She likes him and me and has told me this, I like her ( I have told her this) and want her to be with me and not him.\\n   \n",

                                  I'm going to try to summarize because it's a LOOOONG story.\\n\\nI lived in a different state with my husband and daughter and my own two cats. My Mom bought a house in this state a while back but moved out of it to live with her boyfriend- she offered to give me the house. \\n\\nThe deal as -I- remember it is that we were going to take care of her six cats until she bought a bigger house with her boyfriend. One of the cats was my late great grandma's cat. I agreed to these terms. Later on she said that her small annoying dog was included in this deal. I had no recollection of this being part of it but she insisted that it had always been the deal. (Later found out that when she changed it was the same time she got a new dog - which brought her to the two-pet cap at her boyfriends house (because she brought her other dog with her there))\\n\\nI reluctantly agreed- I was having a difficult time at the place I was staying (invited 'friend' to live in a spare room and she became hostile and refused to do anything to support herself or the household- different AITA I guess). Anyway I wanted ou bad because I didn't want to kick this chick and her baby out so I figured I would just leave. \\n\\nWe get out here and everything is worse than i remember her telling me (house is in worse shape, animals are VERY badly behaved etc) but we get to work. It ended up being four cats (not sure how my math got skewed but I'm telling it as I remember it) because she had already taken one to her place before we got there, plus the stupid dog. \\n\\nIn the first few months, one of the cats ran off through a hole I the house that we did not know existed. We still have not found the cat but we did cover up the hole. Gradually she begins taking animals- first one of the other cats, because it did nothing but howl and howl constantly because none of the damn cats were fixed. She paid to get that cat and one other cat fixed. The last cat (GGC) had already been fixed. My mom and I converse occasionally about the possibility of me keeping the last two cats. She got her new place and after like two months she finally took the dog after us Begging and begging because this dog was a pain in the ass and peed and pooped all over and whined constantly really loudly. I fully agree to take one of the cats but leave GGC up in the air. \\n\\nIn between this stuff we rescue a dog and two kittens off the street. We wanted to keep them but ended up finding them good homes instead because it was too much for us to handle. \\n\\nI continue to ask when mom plans to take GGC, and she keeps putting it off, and I say that she needs to go to the vet. An appointment is not made until I casually suggest calling HER mom about it instead (who was supposed to pay for the vet bills if my mom took the cat in). Cheap shot, but this cat needed treatment and I absolutely could not do it myself. \\n\\nAt the appointment it is discovered that this cat had FIV which is not transmittable to humans but is to other cats and she must be keep away from other cats. At this point we have our two original cats and the one of my mother's that we are keeping. My mother has three dogs and three cats (one newish kitten that SHE rescued and decided to keep) along with a bunch of rodents. It is already well known that my mom is an animal hoarder. \\n\\nWe discuss who takes the cat and it gets a bit heated. We have a three bedroom house (the one she gave of, free of charge) and a toddler and a baby now on the way. She has a two bedroom house, a barn, a lot of land, and it's just her and her husband. This cat should not be kept around other cats. My mom says she has far too many animals to be able to take her and nowhere to keep her. Currently this cat is in our third room, which we would love to be able to use since we will be needing the extra space. My mom then bought a kitten from petsmart, at which point I flipped out, we had a huge fight, and I asked her why EXACTLY she felt she could get another kitten but not take this cat if she did indeed think she had too many animals. She flat out told me she couldn't answer that. She also says she never remembers saying she would take ANY of the cats back, and she also remembers the dog being part of the original deal- all of which conflicts with what I thought was the original deal.\\n\\nI caved and said fuck it, I'll take the cat but you still have to do all the vet stuff. We have not talked about it since, except for me jokingly saying we would trade GGC for the kitten, who LOVES my daughter.\\n\\nAM I THE ASSHOLE???   \n",

Basically, I'm living with a roommate for the next few months although I'd much rather live alone. If you don't want to know the details, just skip the next part:\\n\\n&gt; Six years ago, I moved into this flat with two roommates and back then, I loved it. We got to know each other quite well, and after a while one of my roomies became my girlfriend. The other roommate moved to a different city but also kept her old room, so she could come over from time to time to visit her old friends. Basically, it was just me and my gf most of the time and I got used to that. I didn't want to share my personal space with anyone else anymore.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; But A few months ago, my gf confessed that she had an affair, I broke up and kicked her out. So then her room was empty and I couldn't afford the rent alone. Finding a new (cheap) place to live is a nightmare in my city. In a few months, I will probably start a new job that will require me to move anyway so I decided it was the best to get a (temporary) roommate.\\n\\nNow, when I was showing the flat to my future roommates, I made it pretty clear that personal space and general quietness are very important to me. My now-roomie said it's the same for him and he doesn't mind. I believed him, so he got the room.\\n\\nHe's a really nice guy and he is absolutely quiet, only invites his gf or 1-2 other friends over, doesn't have any big parties, doesn't listen to loud music, doesn't just burst into my room...\\n\\nBut he likes talking to me. He's from Spain and his German (we're in Germany) is not the best, so he obviously wants to speak German in order to improve. I think that's a really great thing but somehow... after a long day of work, I just want to enjoy my dinner quietly without having to talk to anyone. And I find it really hard to have a relaxed conversation when I can hardly understand him and he can hardly understand me.\\n\\nUsually when I start making dinner, he's coming over after a while, starts making small talk, sometimes preparing his own dinner and sitting down at the table with me.\\n\\nI think that this is pretty normal social behavior so I feel like an ass for trying to avoid him.\\n\\nAm I the asshole here?   \n",

there are a few friends of mine there are black. Everyone else is white. His name is Mo. One of his friends asks, \"Hey, where's Mo?\" Mo was sitting right in front of them, but it was dark out and poorly lit, so I say, \"Hey Mo! Smile so we can see you! haha! He didn't take offense, but my wife thought I was in the wrong. I don't think I was. What do you guys think?   \n",

The generally stuff drank, smoked etc and I was pretty high. Throughout the night there was the general banter that I was okay with despite the fact I don't really care much for giving it out, I have pretty thick skin it did not phase me much. It continued on for a while and being scat from what I smoked at around 1am I said to the guys that I wanted to go to sleep so I went to bed. Then it continued. The guys continued to heckle me saying stuff about my girlfriend slinging all sorts of insults while i was trying to sleep. At that point I lost it. I came out and told them all off calling them \"cowards\" and telling them that I wanted a \"refund\" for our post school trip (mind you I know it wasn't going to happen it was pure frustration). It continued on a bit after that while i was trying to sleep until it eventually stopped. At school they are still saying stuff like \"coward\" and \"I want a refund\" and it does not stop. Am I the asshole for losing it that night considering they all bring it up again and again?   \n",

Now my girlfriend and I argue quite a lot and a few months back during an argument she made a personal attack on me and I in turn made a personal attack on her. My girlfriend then turned around and slapped me twice; saying her actions were justified because of what I said. I did not slap her back and simply told her to get out of my room. \\n\\nNow recently we had another argument which was much worse and in this argument I realised where this was going and repeatedly told my girlfriend to leave my room so we could cool down. She refused. \\n\\nEvery single time I tried to make her leave she would scream 'Don't touch me!' Don't touch me!!' \\n\\nSo I went into my bed, under the covers and stopped replying to her in an attempt to cool down, she did not like the fact that I wasn't arguing back with her and thus she in turn poured bottle of water all over my bed covers so that the water seeped through. I then got pissed and tried to snatch the bottle of water away from her to pour it on her and in the process of the struggle she pulled the bottle away really fast and hit her thumb against a wall which turns out ended up breaking her thumb (we didn't know this at the time). \\n\\nAfter this I repeatedly asked her to leave and she refused.\\n\\nI then locked myself in the bathroom and told her I was going to call security; it was at that moment she began to scream saying 'Don't fucking call security!' whilst trying to force open the bathroom door, I didn't want to create drama in my uni halls in front of my room mates (who I didn't really know well) so I held off from calling security (bad decision I know).  \\n\\nOnce it seemed she calmed down I came out the bathroom and the arguing continued. Once again after we verbally insulted each other my girlfriend then slapped me again, at the point I was beginning to lose it but I didn't slap her back. I tried to restrain her and in the process she began trying choke me, I then threw her into the bed to get her away from me.\\n\\nShe got back up and tried to push me again but was unsuccessful. Fast forwarding after more arguing we finally calmed down slightly and there was a silent pause, I then kneeled down to put my charger into a socket and out of no where my girlfriend just pushed me hard and I got knocked into a chair. \\n\\nAt this point. I fucking lose it. \\n\\nI get up, I grab my girlfriend and push her so hard that she goes flying backwards at least 3-4 yards and smashes her back into my door. BANG. \\n\\nAll of sudden she lets off a shriek of pain. Real fucking loud. \\n\\nRemember my neighbors who I mentioned earlier that I don't really know? They hear the screaming and at least 4 guys show up outside my door hearing her screaming 'You pushed me! You pushed me!'. \\n\\nThey in turn say \"Don't worry we're outside, if he's treating you badly we're here and we've already called security!.\" She then tells these guys who are outside my door to get ALL of her friends that live upstairs with her, within 3 minutes I have at least 20 people outside of my door thinking I've just beat my girlfriend up. \\n\\nSecurity arrive and ask me to open the door; I do so and immediately 3 security guards come inside and begin asking what's happened. My girlfriend makes up a story about how she fell despite the fact that she just told the guys outside something entirely different. \\n\\nAs if this couldn't get any worse about 5 minutes later I receive another knock at the door ordering me to open the door. It's the police. \\n\\nOne of the students had called police and upon opening the door these two massive officers walk in. One immediately asks me to leave the room and come outside with him; I do so and as I walk into the corridor I see the looks of all these people I that had once liked me look at me with disgust; no one says anything to me. \\n\\nI'm questioned and let go and according to my girlfriend the police had asked her if she wanted to press charges; she declined.\\n\\nI walked back and I saw everyone from my floor, everyone from her floor, all our mutual friends as well as her close friends from back home who were visiting outside my room once again giving me the most disgusted look thinking I had just beaten her up. \\n\\nNeedless to say I lost all my friends that day and no one cared to even ask me about my side of the story. \\n\\nAt university I now have no friends, and will have to live off campus by myself which means making new friends will be incredibly difficult, it's not helped by the fact that I'm really introverted. I'm also terrified of the prospect of even going out to freshers week as there is only one club at my university and I won't have anyone to go with and anyone that I do bump into from last year will make it really awkward. \\n\\nThis literally keeps me up at night, so tell me, was I an ass hole? \\n\\nEdit* - I've realised that me and my girlfriend can no longer be together.\\n\\nEdit edit* - I just realised PKA is being recorded tonight, perhaps this will be featured on the show. I'd love to hear all your thoughts. \\n\\n   \n",

      I started having prostate orgasms earlier this year. Upon hearing this news my wife wanted to see me have one. Because we have what I thought at the time was a healthy sex life, I obliged. She witnessed my quaking orgasm and almost immediately became jealous and slightly hostile. Jealous is the word she used when I asked her what was wrong. She says that she should be the one that gives me the best orgasms not some toy. I don't disagree with this assessment which is why I think she needs to step up her game in the bedroom. Her answer on the other hand is to simply deny me sex if she suspects that I have been masturbating. I think all of this is fucking ridiculous because I just started using sex toys recently while she has been using them for years. She even uses a vibrator for her clitoris while we are actually having sex. I don't mind this at all. I think that any job which is important is a job which requires tools. As far as I'm concerned, sexual health and satisfaction are important and therefore require the use of specialized tools such as dildos, vibrators, porn, whips, etc. I don't think she has any right to try to discourage me from behaving the same way she does.\\n\\nThe only reason why I think I could even possibly be the asshole in this situation is because early in our marriage when I found out she was using sex toys for masturbating I felt some trepidation. She told me that despite the size difference between my penis and her dildos ( I'm smaller ) sex was still great. She also explained to me that she needed to have her clitoris stimulated during intercourse in order to orgasm consistently. I was able to exercise the anxiety I felt about toys over the course of a few months once we started using vibrators during sex. I understand that she might need some time to get used to this idea but I don't think I should be punished with a no sex policy in the meantime. Especially since she is still using dildos. Am I the asshole?   \n",

I'm making this because I'm not really that sure if he is one or not, but I will be making this from my point of view]\\n\\nContext: My Theology teacher (male, approx 35) was supposed to go to a doctors appointment, but the sub was unable to fill in, so he probably became pissed that day. I am a male senior in highschool probably pissed him off.\\n\\nIn Theology class, my teacher (I'll call him Mr. Johnson) asked the class who has their homework from his desk. I said that I did, since I was close to him, I decided to try to hand it to him. Unfortunately, the distance between me and him was about a yard, so I tossed it onto his desk. He caught it and then ripped the paper and saying, \"You don't throw things to me.\" in a stern voice and then threw the shreds in the recycling bin.\\n\\nI decided that I would pick up what's left of my homework after class. About 5 minutes after Mr. Johnson ripped up my homework, another teacher (I'll call her Ms. Robertson) came into class asking for the recycling bin, so I was unable to take back my homework, tape it back together, and attempt to try to return it in. Because Ms. Robertson \"just happened\" to come into the class asking for the recycling bin, I'm very positive that Mr. Johnson did this, since he already knew that Ms. Robertson will come in for the bin.\\n\\nLater on in class, one of my classmates (I'll call him Sean) turned around and told me that two years ago, Mr. Johnson burned his notes in class. It turns out that, at the time, Mr. Johnson told Sean to not take notes, so Mr. Johnson put Sean's notes into a bowl and lit them on fire. After hearing this, Mr. Johnson's behavior is not that abnormal to my situation.\\n\\nCoincidentally, the topic of Plato's interpretation of 'what is evil?' came. Accoriding to Plato, there is not such thing as not good and that evil is just not accepting good. In a way, Mr. Johnson tearing my paper can be seen as him teaching me a lesson on respect/his untold class rules. After school, I asked him if I could make up the homework. He said not to worry about it and that he will accept it. Basically, this entire situation was an extremely harsh 'slap on the wrist' scare tactic punishment from my teacher.\\n\\nSo, what I'm trying to ask is, is Mr. Johnson an asshole for over reacting, or do I deserve what happened because of my disrepect?\\n\\nTL;DR: Teacher, probably pissed because sub no-showed, ripped up my homework because I tossed it to him when he was a couple of inches away. He saw that as disrepect, and decided to teach me a lesson about respect, but he ended up taking the homework in the end.   \n",

There's no quick way to do this, so I had to do it all by hand in the most efficient manner possible.\\n\\n#Skype Transcript\\n\\nTerry: we're hanging out at Jacob's at 8:00, you're invited\\n\\nMe: delightful\\n\\nTerry: was that sarcasm?\\n\\nTerry: I think it was\\n\\nMe: no\\n\\nTerry: I know somebody else\\n\\nTerry: who does that thing you're doing now\\n\\nMe: I just woke up from a rather ineffective nap. I'm not a great conersationalist at the moment\\n\\nTerry: want me to help you?\\n\\nTerry: I'll do it anyways\\n\\nTerry: the ideal response was either a \"I'll be there\" or \"I'm staying home tonight\"\\n\\nMe: I'll be there\\n\\nMe: you condescending twat\\n\\nTerry: lol\\n\\nTerry: I have another friend who fucks that up every goddamn day\\n\\nTerry: on purpose\\n\\nTerry: and it drives me goddamn crazy because they'll say something cryptic after being invited to something and I won't actually know if they're coming or not\\n\\nMe: Good, I'll have to be sure to do it more if you're going to be such a condescending prat about it\\n\\nTerry: You're only being like that because you're not on the recieving end\\n\\nTerry: so you don't know how frustrating it can be\\n\\nTerry: to herd this group of cats we call friends\\n\\nMe: \"I have another friend who fucks that up\", \"want me to help you?\"\"You're only being like that...\"\\n \\nMe: If this is the mood you're in, I think I'll pass today.\\n\\nTerry: stop being so sensitive\\n\\nTerry: you want an explanation of why I was so annoyed? fine\\n\\nTerry: Our plans literally hinge on whether you wanted to come or not\\n\\nTerry: plus my mother wouldn't leave me alone about what my plans were later tonight and I couldn't give her an answer\\n\\nTerry: and it was time sensitive\\n\\nTerry: and then when you do actually respond to the message I send you, I still don't know whether you're coming or not\\n\\nTerry: and then you send me another message and I still don't know\\n\\nTerry: and then you send me another message and I still don't know.\\n\\nTerry: And I don't think you're aware of this, but everyone who talks to you on IM has no clue if the next message they will recieve from you will be in 3 seconds or 30 minutes.\\n\\nTerry: so sorry if I'm I wasn't totally patient with you today\\n\\nTerry: happy?\\n\\nMe: At the moment, I'm sincerely trying to make the calculated deicision of whether or not we're going to enjoy ourselves tonight, which puts a strain on my powers of prescience, seeing as that's a faculty I lack. A (short-tempered) apology (with several comments on my ultimate responsibility in the matter), no matter how sincere, was not my ultimate  aim. Because right now it seems to me that tempers on either end could spark up at this point, and then we'd all have to enjoy that awkward nightmare.\\n\\nSo I'm going to stay here tonight. We'll pick up game night on better terms.\\n\\nMe: It may be a surprise to note that I was quite on edge yesterday as well, and I wouldn't have trusted my own temperment had I not already made plans before I found myself in that situation. I am not going to tempt fate on that matter now.\\n\\nTerry: It was very clear that you didn't have your heart set on hanging out yesterday\\n\\nMe: Yes, it occurred in the intevening time between 6 and 6:30, hence our lateness\\n\\nMe: and [my girlfriend]'s absence\\n\\nTerry: That was my assumption too, but it's not really my business\\n\\nMe: It was Jacob's assumption, and he did consider his business to the extent that he wanted to confirm it.\\n\\nMe: That's neither here nor there\\n\\nTerry: also, this isn't \"A mood\" that I'm in, I always communicate like this. I think that people forget that when they're having a bad day because it gives them an excuse to get mad at somebody.\\n\\nTerry: Have you ever seen me flip out on somebody during a game night? Can you even imagine what that would look like?\\n\\nTerry: because I can't\\n\\nTerry: I leave my significant grievances at the door. I only hold on to the petty, comedy-inducing ones.\\n\\nTerry: so if you think that you're gonna have fun then show up and if you don't think you're gonna have fun don't show up, but you can be sure that if I make the decision to participate, I'm gonna try to have a good time.\\n\\nMe: Then let me rephrase. I consider solely myself a liability this evening and I have no intention nor desire to come. I'll extend the offer to [my girlfriend, a usual member], but I am clearly not able to enjoy the fesitivites\\n\\nMe: She's not particularly interested. I'm sure that comes as no surprise, but I thought I'd at least entertain the possibility.\\n\\nMe: My apologies for ruining the plans this evening   \n",

stay with em (he was 18 at the time 19 now), because he didn't have anywhere to stay and they had a spare room.\\n\\nNow he would always hang around my girlfriend and I before he even moved in and I could tell he liked her but I gave no fucks as I didn't feel threatened by him.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I recently broke up after being together for two years, and I found out earlier today he's snapchatting her and telling her he likes her and told her he jacks off to her facebook pics.\\n\\nI went to my parents about it and they're going to kick him out at my request, AITA?   \n",

I recently have been dealing with quite a bit, being depressed and such. My mom hasnt talked to me in about 2 months, (we are normally really close ). Recently my wife and her had a falling out. Where my wife felt she was walking in and out of our life to much and didnt want it to effect our kids. My mom responded with a status about how were making the wrong decisions and we used them and everything else. Havent asked them for anything in quite awhile. I responded basically telling everyone on the fb thread to go fuck them selves for saying things like, they were to young to deal with kids thats why this is happening, that we are using our kids as pawns among other things. My main question is am i the asshole for responding. And did i do the right thing sticking up for my wife when i was caught in the middle? \\n\\nThis is the comment i made..... \\nTruthfully. This is nuts. Everyone is attacking everyone im fucking sick of it. Sharon you have been deleted off my page for about a year maybe more and on my wifes about 6 months. All of this shit should of stayed private. In the end friends dont come before family. Im sick of the bs. Children as pawns thats a joke. When your unable to leave your house because of money or other problems thats not my fault. I cant take being walked out on anymore. Anyone who is willing to call someone a child when they havent even met them, they are completely un informed nor should they be judging someone on how good of a parent they are.\\n\\nI understand i jumped around alot in that i responded to about 6 comments at once.   \n",

month. I play college football in Canada and have a practice scheduled for the same day. She asked for my schedule and I gave it to her and she remarked that I had football on the same day. I said something along the lines of 'Yeah that's a shame, oh well we'll celebrate afterwards and as well on the weekend.' She seems to accept this for a while and we don't speak of it. The other day however she became very emotional, comparing me to other couples and demanding that I skip the practice. I am just on the cusp of starting on the team and I have never missed a football practice any other season. She has talked to her friends about this and of course they all think I'm a dick for not skipping football. \\n\\nI feel as though I'm taking a stand for what I believe in as I am sure that drinking and celebrating with my girlfriend and our friends would be a lot more fun than running suicides and scrimmaging however I am committed to the team and I want to do whatever I can to start. I've tried to explain that I'd love to spend the day with her but I have to make sacrifices to succeed, but she can't see my viewpoint whatsoever.\\nPlease tell me, am I the asshole?   \n",

                              My current girlfriend and I have been dating about year and a half, my ex girlfriend and I dated about 2 years ago, there was a 3-4 period between them. My girlfriend used to completely despise my ex but after a while she started feeling bad for her because when we broke up it was not on the best of terms. But now my girlfriend and ex are friends and have classes together and hang out a lot, they are as I'm typing this. I'm not the biggest fan of my ex but i don't mind if they hangout, it just makes me uncomfortable. Am I the asshole for feeling that way? It's getting to the point where I try to call her and tell her some news or something and she won't answer because she's hanging with my ex and doesn't want to make her feel bad or something. I just want to know where y'all stand.  I have no desire to be friends with my ex again, I just feel uncomfortable about it and wanted to know if that's an asshole move or not. Thanks!   \n",

she is quite literally, constantly singing. She loves to sing and so if there is any silence, she will start singing. No matter what. Just finished a conversation on the couch? Looks at her phone and starts singing. Nothing playing on the radio in the car? Starts singing. Making dinner? I'll let you guess. You get the idea. What's more is that she sings the same thing over and over. She'll have a \"song of the day\" basically and sing that same song all day. I no longer know what silence is. \\n\\nAm I an asshole for wanting her to not sing as much? I haven't brought it up with her yet because I know how much she loves singing and she's said stuff like \"everyone always eventually tells me to stop singing at some point\". I truly cannot emphasize how much she loves singing. I don't want to hurt her feelings by asking for her to not sing as much, but I think it is driving me nuts. \\n\\nAm I being an asshole or being selfish? Thank you for any and all comments.\\n   \n",

study room. It just consists of two tables, a few chairs and a bathroom (it's probably a converted handicapped dormroom). The door on it has a lock that I use when I'm in there with my girlfriend (actually studying). There's a sign on the door saying \"please leave the door open when you leave.\" I took this to mean it's completely ok to have it closed when you're in there, and by extension, its ok to lock it. If you weren't allowed to lock the door, the room wouldn't have a lock on it. Please note every dorm-room in this building is a single, and thus this room isn't occupied very often.\\n\\nSo anyway, the other night someone knocked, and I opened it. They said i'm not allowed to lock it and pointed to the aforementioned sign. I was having a bad day so I knew that anything I would've said would've been worse than what was appropriate so I kept my mouth shut. \\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nEdit: I totally forgot to mention there's a much larger study area right next to this room   \n",

her dad was dating someone with a son whom she grew really close to and considered him her brother after a month. When me, her and my group as friends met him we all liked having him around but slowly things started to degrade. This guy started being a total ass hole to all of us in one way or another and eventually we all began to hate him besides me. On an important note, he moved about an hour away about a month after me and this girl got together so he rarely visits. Anyway he eventually says that he hates me and my best friend in the group and that he hates that my girlfriend is dating me, despite this my girlfriend still wants to talk to him even though he's said a lot of hurtful things to me and my friends. So once he says this I begin to hate him back and here's the part where I question if I'm an asshole or not. I ask that my girlfriend cut off all her connections to him and she refuses and continues to talk to him. So, am I an asshole for asking?   \n",

group of friends at our favorite restaurant every Sunday. However, on Saturday, one friend and I were particularly hungry. I contacted the rest of the group and asked if they wanted to go today as well. Everyone did except my girlfriend, who was busy. We went. We still went on Sunday. One member skipped Sunday because he didn't want to eat at the same spot twice in a row. My girlfriend was pissed and wouldn't talk to me until a few hours before the event on Sunday. She still held a grudge and her moods was not high on Sunday and the days after. Am I the asshole?   \n",

                                                          My girlfriend is an addict. She was for about 4 years. She just got out of rehab. She has never paid for drugs. Friends would give them to her, but she told me about 3 days ago that she also had sex for them. She has had sex with 3 guys (im not one of them) and about 13 girls. She mostly had sex with girls for drugs. But one of the guys was for her precious xanax. (the other two were long term boyfriends) i know exactly who the other two are. But she will not give me ANY details on the 3rd guy. Not a name, age, hell even if they wore a condom. This stuff matters to me. I love her, but i cant get over it. Am I an asshole for making such a big deal of it? (ive asked her about 4 times in as loving a way as possible. I dont plan on saying anything to the guy i just want to know everyone shes had sex with. She doesnt have this problem with me. Im a virgin.) I would tell her LITERALLY anything. I get that she needs to come to terms with her addiction and she said she would tell me in time but i feel that i need to know now. (Im not going to leave her over this no matter what. Shes still the same person she was a week ago)\\n\\nEdit: we had a talk a little bit after i posted this and she told me all the details i really cared about. They wore a condom. He didnt blow it insidd her. He isnt dangorous. So shes safe. I realized i didnt even care about name. I just wanted to know. Especially that last part. \\n\\nEdit 2: well, shit. Looks like im an asshole... Time to buy a dozeb roses with a TIFU card.    \n",

friend Katie hasn't talked to me ever since I started dating her ex Matt 5 months ago. A little history first:\\n\\n - I've known Katie since 6th grade and we are both 22 now. We've had the same group of friends ever since we met and have continued to be in the same small group of friends up until this all happened. Katie started acting weird ever since we finished our undergrad. I mean weird as in she had been more anti-social, more critical of strangers, and just generally less pleasant to be around. I talked about it with a couple of my other friends in our group and they agreed that she'd been acting weird ever since she didn't get her dream job coming out of school.\\n\\n - Matt and I met my sophomore year of high school and he and I instantly became good friends. He was a year younger than I and I was already in a relationship (that lasted until I was 20), so I never thought of him as more than a good friend. He would listen to me if I was having trouble with my boyfriend and I would listen to him bitch about whatever problems he was having. We would go a month or two without contact sometimes, but would pick up wherever we left off once we ran into each other again.\\n\\n - Well around the time I broke up with my boyfriend, Matt and Katie started dating. I thought it was the best thing in the world because two of my good friends were dating. Well I was wrong. They were together for a little over a year and in that time they fought for at least half of it. Katie was downright mean to Matt. She told him his friends were always annoying, that she didn't really like his parents, that his hobbies (mostly playing his instruments) were dumb, etc. In hindsight, I should have sad something. But when either would bitch to me about how the other had done something stupid, I insisted that I was to stay neutral because it wouldn't be fair to either of them if I took a side. They both respected my decision.\\n\\nSo Matt and Katie broke up back in December of 2014, but kept in contact until the end of March this year. I saw Matt, without Katie being with him, for the first time in about 6 months in mid-April of this year and we chatted for a little bit. He told me how much happier he was without Katie and I just said I was glad he was happy.\\nThen we started talking more and more throughout the month. It was the first time we had been friends without one of us in a relationship so we were beginning to talk like never before. And by the end of May this year we had started dating.\\n\\nWhile all that was happening, I was thinking about how Katie would react. I knew it may not be right, but it had been 5 months since they broke up and she was a major bitch to him half the relationship. So I told her a week before we started dating and she was infuriated. All she told me was that it wasn't okay and that she didn't approve at all. She has avoided seeing me at all costs and it has put some tension in our group of friends. She refuses to discuss it with anyone as well.\\n\\nMy logic is that they broke up 5 months before we started dating and she was a jerk to him for so long. Her logic, I'm assuming, is that I betrayed her. So Reddit, am I the asshole?   \n",

is having a birthday/passion party. From what I understand, a passion party is pretty much where they try to get you to buy sex toys.\\n\\nI told her that was a weird concept for a birthday party. It doesn't even have to do with it being a passion party. I would find it awkward if it was a makeup/knife/herbalife party too. What kind of person would invite you to their birthday party hoping/expecting you to buy products? She seemed pretty angry about me saying that.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for saying that the party idea was a weird concept, or am I totally out of line?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           So for the past few days my boyfriend got a new phone and has been playing with some kind of music app around me in which he's mixing songs together. I'm hating every minute and gently encouraged him to finish a song and then play that for me, rather than practice around me because some of what he's doing just sounds awful and some sounds really great. I go to a college with a lot of music theatre majors who tend to go around singing in the hallways, which the rest of us at school find profoundly annoying. Sometimes my boyfriend can be really dense, and I'll tell him something and he just won't listen. I've had to explain to him what my major is at school about five times before he finally knew what I was talking about. \\n\\nAnyway, after he didn't listen to my requests for him to wait to finish a song to play this around me, I decided to be more clear, however I was also kind of mean. I said \"Fucking musicians don't care that nobody wants to hear them practice.\" And explained that I'm subjected to practicing musicians daily and don't want to be subjected to this at home. I was already annoyed at him when I said this because he had taken me to the dentist in my car and didn't have a ride back home. He wanted me to drive him home, and I said \"What was the point of you driving me today? It was to not have to drive today. I'll get you a cab, but I'm really disappointed you did not think this through.\" He thinks it's not a big deal because he got me where I needed to be and figured he would figure the rest out as he went along, but that kind of thing makes me wonder if he's even a reliable enough person to be my boyfriend. I know he doesn't do a very good job planning ahead for anything. I feel like I should have asked a friend for a ride, I have friends who are so much more reliable than he is. \\n\\nSo today he texts me that I need to be more sensitive to him about his music. I really offended him with the 'fucking musicians' comment. I feel like I'm being generous by calling him a musician, when all he's doing with music is playing with a new app on his phone and he gave up on bass guitar years ago. We've been together since May and if he had thought he was a DJ in May I wouldn't have started dating him. I have always hated the guy at the party who thinks he's a DJ and has no real skills. He knows already that I don't like what I call 'song ADD' wherein a person doesn't play an entire song and keeps skipping and that's basically what he's doing with this app. I've also said \"Remixing a song is like admitting you were wrong\" or \"Why would they remix this song, it's perfect in it's original form\" and other such things, so he does already know that I don't like this sort of thing.\\n\\nSo which one of us is the bigger asshole right now? I know I'm asshole for using harsh language and knocking his passion, but I also think if he's so passionate about making music, why didn't he do anything like this before he got a new phone? \\n\\nTL;DR Boyfriend thinks he's a DJ on his iPhone and I said musicians suck for thinking everyone wants to hear them practice.   \n",

               So me and my girlfriend started dating in high school about 4 months before graduating. Everything was going great until the end of summer when she moved 4 hours away for school. We mutually decided that we should go for it, because she initially said that she would return to our current city to go to a university here after this year of university ends.\\n\\nHowever, just by what she tells me, she is very enveloped in the school in regards to clubs, activities, professional connections, and a LOT of friends. And because of all this, she never talks to me unless I initiate conversation over text. I don't know if this is a common thing among girls to just never talk to the guy first, but it's pretty ridiculous that I ALWAYS have to start conversation if we are going to actually talk.\\n\\nAnyways, I don't want to have to wait 4 fucking years for her to finish school just to see if this miraculously works out. Even then, she could just decide that I'm not worth keeping around and completely remove me from her life before then.\\n\\nI know it was kinda stupid getting into a relationship at that stage of my life, but knowing me, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself knowing I never at least gave it a shot.\\n\\nSo, am I that asshole for thinking it would benefit us both to end this emotionally draining relationship that I'm not enjoying?   \n",

                               I work retail for a small company, nothing you would have heard of. I've worked for the company for about five months, and in that time, my location's sales have skyrocketed. I've been promoted to manager (a promotion in title only, i don't really do much authoritative stuff), and I've been offered additional promotions. I've turned them down due to other circumstances (namely a lack of transportation), but all of this is to illustrate that my boss has good reason to like me and keep me happy as an employee.\\n\\nLast week, he showed up at my location on a day when i wasn't working and dropped off an ipad for \"me/the store.\" As far as i can tell, it's for me, and I'm welcome to use it for research at the store, but it's really mine. He said it was a gift because i was doing so well with sales, and to help encourage me to keep it up. Not unheard of, and i was thrilled to hear about it.\\n\\nI dropped by the store to pick it up, and my excitement...faltered. it's an old ipad 2, which is swiftly becoming outdated/obsolete. It's refurbished, which i don't really have a problem with, but...it's broken. There's a massive dent in one corner which prevents the glass from sitting properly in the frame, so dust gets underneath the screen and generally fucks things up. The home button also doesn't work. Fortunately, i know how to fix all of these things, and i have the resources to do so. I'm just a little miffed that he gifted me a broken device. I don't know if he *knew* it was broken and knew I could fix it, or if he just didn't check it out before he gave it to me.\\n\\n**in summary**\\n\\nMy boss gave me a broken ipad as a \"you're awesome, keep it up\" present.\\n\\n**boss points:** he didn't have to give me this ipad, he did it out of generosity. He may not have known it was broken, or he may have trusted me to fix it myself. He may also have gotten the best he could afford - I'm not important enough in the company to know how much extra money there is to throw around.\\n\\n**my points:** it's *broken.* if this gift is a reflection of his opinion of me, I'm honestly insulted. It's an old device, bordering on useless, and it's broken. If you really cared, wouldn't you get me something nice that reflected it?\\n\\nI feel like an asshole for being upset, but my husband thinks I'm justified in being insulted. I'm not going to give it back or do anything like that...looking a gift horse in the mouth and whatnot. I'm going to suck it up, fix what's broken, and use it if i can. I'm just wondering if I'm right for being miffed.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                      (I'm male and 15. It asked for age and gender so there ya go.)\\n\\nSo I'm friends with a guy, we'll call him Drew. I've known Drew for a little over a year and we're pretty good friends. Last week he found out I have a premium Spotify account and immediately asked for the account info so he could use it. \\n\\nI denied him this because:\\n\\n* I don't feel comfortable sharing passwords and account info with anyone, no matter how much I trust them. I don't know if they'll share it with anyone past that and I have potentially sensitive information on there\\n\\n* It doesn't feel right to me that I work to pay for it and he would get it for free\\n\\n* I don't want him fucking with my playlists (selfish but ya know)\\n\\n* I don't want him deleting/locking me out of my account somehow\\n\\n(Again I trust this person to some degree but those are still my reasons.)\\n\\nI explained these points to him and he got pissed at me for not letting him have it. I called on our friend Evan as a third party and Evan agreed with my reasons and respected them but also sided with Drew slightly saying that it was a dick move to not let him use it. In my opinion he's not neutral because he mostly sides with Drew on this (and other things)\\n\\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for not letting a guy use my Spotify premium account for the above reasons? I'll answer any questions.   \n",
