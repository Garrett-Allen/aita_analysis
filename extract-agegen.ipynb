So all of my husband’s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\\n\\nI’ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we’ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she’s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house’s. \\n\\nHere’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?</td>\n",

Well she didn't say that they weren't for everyone amd since she frequently goes grocery shopping for my mom I thought they were for everyone so I ate one today.  She goes and asks my little sister (14) if she had them, she says no so my sister comes in my room while I'm trying to sleep (the box for the cookies were in my trash can because there was one left and I'm not dirtying a dish if i don't have to. Well she sees it amd takes it out of the trash and throws at me which woke me up. She tells me that she wants me to pay for the whole box because her kid is sad she didn't get the last cookie. I said that I'd pay for the single cookie I took she refused.  So she goes and says she's not leaving my room until I give her $5 so I call my mom and my mom tells her to get out of my room. She ends up saying that she'll wait until I go to school on monday (I'm 16 so still in hs)  so she can steal my stuff to pay for the box (she's done this before when I didn't know that the ice cream in the freezer was hers and she stole my $100 hair straighter that I had to break into her room to get back) I tell her to get out again and she does. But not before she goes and kicks my cats food bowl and threatens to dump her litter box out.\\n\\nAnd earlier today she was also complaining about my other older sister (21) getting mad at her for eating a donut that she bought and she thought they were for everyone. So I called her a hypocrite \\n\\nSo reddit aita for eating a cookie?</td>\n",

I’ve been getting really frustrated recently, because everything in the apartment is constantly getting moved around, and its annoying to constantly look for my things, including my server book, my work shoes, and my ipad to finish projects. BASICALLY EVERYTHING IMPORTANT TO ME RN TO MAKE MONEY. Come to find out, it’s because my roommate is constantly touching my stuff and moving it around to clean. To which I understand, but usually people move stuff back to their normal spots, if it isn’t THEIR OWN STUFF. So, I tried talking to her about it, but like any sit-down convo with her, she thinks I’m personally attacking her. Ive tried multiple ways to talk to her about it and it just comes out to the same conclusion. In her words, “ You’re the child and you need to shut the fuck up”. When she said that, I lost it. I told her, “ At least I’m not touching other people shit and then blaming it on other people!”, which made her upset and cry to our neighbors, who are now telling me to apologize. \\nI will apologize, if it means a better friendship in the end. But guys, I’ve genuinely tried every single way possible. AITA?\\n\\n\\n\\nQUICK EDIT: Just to lyk i basically live in the living room area. but my space is very well defined ( basically yk what part is bedroom and what part is the living room) Ive very OCD about my stuff and keep very tidy. I don’t leave anything in her way or anything like that. I’m a people pleaser and I try not to make anyone upset or uncomfortable in their own home. I leave my important things on my nightstand, thats away from the living room area.</td>\n",

He doesn’t have a cell, so I can’t call or text either.\\n\\nWe planned a “prank” together (its just a version of the same prank we do every year). This year we are dressing as each other. He would be dressing fancy/paying more attention to his outfit. I would be mismatching with a graphic tee. It’s nice.\\n\\nHowever, I thought that I could do a kind of “double-cross”. I would prank him by dressing like I normally would. It would be him dressing as me and me as me. I thought it might be fun, but at the same time I don’t want him to be mad at me.\\n\\nI would just do it if we were both at home, and then I could change into his clothes. But I can’t. We’ll both be stuck in whatever clothes we brought. Especially since I babysit from 05:30 til 22:00. Without going home.\\n\\nAges are 15f (almost 16!) and 13m. This is all fun, even if he did get mad he’d be over it in an hour. Please don’t start making any assumptions like a lot of AITA people do.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Using a throwaway because my sister has reddit. This turned out to be much more serious than it should have been in my opinion. I'm wondering what the internet thinks. So here it goes.\\n\\nI (32M) have a younger sister (29F) Victoria. As her older brother, I've always had a close relationship with her and I tease her quite a bit about a lot of things. She usually likes it and laughs along with everybody else. \\n\\nVictoria has been a playgirl since she was a teen. She has't really changed this pattern of her through the years. Not even after getting a high-end job that requires orofessionalism at its best. She's still the playgirl. And I tease her about this at family gatherings. She embraces that side of her and it's completely okay. She has even mentioned a few times that this is much better than our parents pressuring her to settle down.\\n\\nLast week, my mom invited Victoria and I over for my dad's birthday, along with my wife and son. I was surprised to see that Victoria had a girl with her. She introduced Rose (24F) as her date. I'm totally okay with Vic being bi. \\n\\nDuring the celebration, I cracked a few jokes about Victoria being a playgirl 'back in the day'. Jokes were harmless, mostly like 'oh come on half of your high school class were your ex', or 'were any of my friends not your boyfriend at some point' and similar stuff.\\n\\nIt was mostly received well and everyone laughed, even Vic. We were all having a very good time. I went to the kitchen to get my son something and Vic followed me. She told me I needed to shut up, that she was hardly controlling her temper and that I was ruining the night.\\n\\nI was like does Rose think she's your first? And she got mad she said what she talked about with Rose was pvriate but that I needed to stop making these comments right now. Even Rose laughed and was having a good time so I don't really understand.\\n\\nI told Vic I wouldn't do it anymore but she said the damage was done. I mean everyone really likes Vic, she's a natural charmer. And she's not gonna change overnight. So was what I did over the limit?</td>\n",

       "0  I (26 F) am married to K (25 M) , i met him a few year back when my best friend and his best friend started dating, after that our friend groups kind of joined together. So all of my husband’s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\\n\\nI’ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we’ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she’s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house’s. \\n\\nHere’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?   \n",

They were $5 for a 8 pack. Well she didn't say that they weren't for everyone amd since she frequently goes grocery shopping for my mom I thought they were for everyone so I ate one today.  She goes and asks my little sister (14) if she had them, she says no so my sister comes in my room while I'm trying to sleep (the box for the cookies were in my trash can because there was one left and I'm not dirtying a dish if i don't have to. Well she sees it amd takes it out of the trash and throws at me which woke me up. She tells me that she wants me to pay for the whole box because her kid is sad she didn't get the last cookie. I said that I'd pay for the single cookie I took she refused.  So she goes and says she's not leaving my room until I give her $5 so I call my mom and my mom tells her to get out of my room. She ends up saying that she'll wait until I go to school on monday (I'm 16 so still in hs)  so she can steal my stuff to pay for the box (she's done this before when I didn't know that the ice cream in the freezer was hers and she stole my $100 hair straighter that I had to break into her room to get back) I tell her to get out again and she does. But not before she goes and kicks my cats food bowl and threatens to dump her litter box out.\\n\\nAnd earlier today she was also complaining about my other older sister (21) getting mad at her for eating a donut that she bought and she thought they were for everyone. So I called her a hypocrite \\n\\nSo reddit aita for eating a cookie?   \n",

I’ve been getting really frustrated recently, because everything in the apartment is constantly getting moved around, and its annoying to constantly look for my things, including my server book, my work shoes, and my ipad to finish projects. BASICALLY EVERYTHING IMPORTANT TO ME RN TO MAKE MONEY. Come to find out, it’s because my roommate is constantly touching my stuff and moving it around to clean. To which I understand, but usually people move stuff back to their normal spots, if it isn’t THEIR OWN STUFF. So, I tried talking to her about it, but like any sit-down convo with her, she thinks I’m personally attacking her. Ive tried multiple ways to talk to her about it and it just comes out to the same conclusion. In her words, “ You’re the child and you need to shut the fuck up”. When she said that, I lost it. I told her, “ At least I’m not touching other people shit and then blaming it on other people!”, which made her upset and cry to our neighbors, who are now telling me to apologize. \\nI will apologize, if it means a better friendship in the end. But guys, I’ve genuinely tried every single way possible. AITA?\\n\\n\\n\\nQUICK EDIT: Just to lyk i basically live in the living room area. but my space is very well defined ( basically yk what part is bedroom and what part is the living room) Ive very OCD about my stuff and keep very tidy. I don’t leave anything in her way or anything like that. I’m a people pleaser and I try not to make anyone upset or uncomfortable in their own home. I leave my important things on my nightstand, thats away from the living room area.   \n",

Both my brother and I won’t be home (he’s at a sleepover and I’m heading over to go babysitting), which is why I can’t ask him. He doesn’t have a cell, so I can’t call or text either.\\n\\nWe planned a “prank” together (its just a version of the same prank we do every year). This year we are dressing as each other. He would be dressing fancy/paying more attention to his outfit. I would be mismatching with a graphic tee. It’s nice.\\n\\nHowever, I thought that I could do a kind of “double-cross”. I would prank him by dressing like I normally would. It would be him dressing as me and me as me. I thought it might be fun, but at the same time I don’t want him to be mad at me.\\n\\nI would just do it if we were both at home, and then I could change into his clothes. But I can’t. We’ll both be stuck in whatever clothes we brought. Especially since I babysit from 05:30 til 22:00. Without going home.\\n\\nAges are 15f (almost 16!) and 13m. This is all fun, even if he did get mad he’d be over it in an hour. Please don’t start making any assumptions like a lot of AITA people do.   \n",

This turned out to be much more serious than it should have been in my opinion. I'm wondering what the internet thinks. So here it goes.\\n\\nI (32M) have a younger sister (29F) Victoria. As her older brother, I've always had a close relationship with her and I tease her quite a bit about a lot of things. She usually likes it and laughs along with everybody else. \\n\\nVictoria has been a playgirl since she was a teen. She has't really changed this pattern of her through the years. Not even after getting a high-end job that requires orofessionalism at its best. She's still the playgirl. And I tease her about this at family gatherings. She embraces that side of her and it's completely okay. She has even mentioned a few times that this is much better than our parents pressuring her to settle down.\\n\\nLast week, my mom invited Victoria and I over for my dad's birthday, along with my wife and son. I was surprised to see that Victoria had a girl with her. She introduced Rose (24F) as her date. I'm totally okay with Vic being bi. \\n\\nDuring the celebration, I cracked a few jokes about Victoria being a playgirl 'back in the day'. Jokes were harmless, mostly like 'oh come on half of your high school class were your ex', or 'were any of my friends not your boyfriend at some point' and similar stuff.\\n\\nIt was mostly received well and everyone laughed, even Vic. We were all having a very good time. I went to the kitchen to get my son something and Vic followed me. She told me I needed to shut up, that she was hardly controlling her temper and that I was ruining the night.\\n\\nI was like does Rose think she's your first? And she got mad she said what she talked about with Rose was pvriate but that I needed to stop making these comments right now. Even Rose laughed and was having a good time so I don't really understand.\\n\\nI told Vic I wouldn't do it anymore but she said the damage was done. I mean everyone really likes Vic, she's a natural charmer. And she's not gonna change overnight. So was what I did over the limit?   \n",

So all of my husband’s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\\n\\nI’ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we’ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she’s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house’s. \\n\\nHere’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?\n",

They were $5 for a 8 pack. Well she didn't say that they weren't for everyone amd since she frequently goes grocery shopping for my mom I thought they were for everyone so I ate one today.  She goes and asks my little sister (14) if she had them, she says no so my sister comes in my room while I'm trying to sleep (the box for the cookies were in my trash can because there was one left and I'm not dirtying a dish if i don't have to. Well she sees it amd takes it out of the trash and throws at me which woke me up. She tells me that she wants me to pay for the whole box because her kid is sad she didn't get the last cookie. I said that I'd pay for the single cookie I took she refused.  So she goes and says she's not leaving my room until I give her $5 so I call my mom and my mom tells her to get out of my room. She ends up saying that she'll wait until I go to school on monday (I'm 16 so still in hs)  so she can steal my stuff to pay for the box (she's done this before when I didn't know that the ice cream in the freezer was hers and she stole my $100 hair straighter that I had to break into her room to get back) I tell her to get out again and she does. But not before she goes and kicks my cats food bowl and threatens to dump her litter box out.\\n\\nAnd earlier today she was also complaining about my other older sister (21) getting mad at her for eating a donut that she bought and she thought they were for everyone. So I called her a hypocrite \\n\\nSo reddit aita for eating a cookie?\n",

I’ve been getting really frustrated recently, because everything in the apartment is constantly getting moved around, and its annoying to constantly look for my things, including my server book, my work shoes, and my ipad to finish projects. BASICALLY EVERYTHING IMPORTANT TO ME RN TO MAKE MONEY. Come to find out, it’s because my roommate is constantly touching my stuff and moving it around to clean. To which I understand, but usually people move stuff back to their normal spots, if it isn’t THEIR OWN STUFF. So, I tried talking to her about it, but like any sit-down convo with her, she thinks I’m personally attacking her. Ive tried multiple ways to talk to her about it and it just comes out to the same conclusion. In her words, “ You’re the child and you need to shut the fuck up”. When she said that, I lost it. I told her, “ At least I’m not touching other people shit and then blaming it on other people!”, which made her upset and cry to our neighbors, who are now telling me to apologize. \\nI will apologize, if it means a better friendship in the end. But guys, I’ve genuinely tried every single way possible. AITA?\\n\\n\\n\\nQUICK EDIT: Just to lyk i basically live in the living room area. but my space is very well defined ( basically yk what part is bedroom and what part is the living room) Ive very OCD about my stuff and keep very tidy. I don’t leave anything in her way or anything like that. I’m a people pleaser and I try not to make anyone upset or uncomfortable in their own home. I leave my important things on my nightstand, thats away from the living room area.\n",

Both my brother and I won’t be home (he’s at a sleepover and I’m heading over to go babysitting), which is why I can’t ask him. He doesn’t have a cell, so I can’t call or text either.\\n\\nWe planned a “prank” together (its just a version of the same prank we do every year). This year we are dressing as each other. He would be dressing fancy/paying more attention to his outfit. I would be mismatching with a graphic tee. It’s nice.\\n\\nHowever, I thought that I could do a kind of “double-cross”. I would prank him by dressing like I normally would. It would be him dressing as me and me as me. I thought it might be fun, but at the same time I don’t want him to be mad at me.\\n\\nI would just do it if we were both at home, and then I could change into his clothes. But I can’t. We’ll both be stuck in whatever clothes we brought. Especially since I babysit from 05:30 til 22:00. Without going home.\\n\\nAges are 15f (almost 16!) and 13m. This is all fun, even if he did get mad he’d be over it in an hour. Please don’t start making any assumptions like a lot of AITA people do.\n",

This turned out to be much more serious than it should have been in my opinion. I'm wondering what the internet thinks. So here it goes.\\n\\nI (32M) have a younger sister (29F) Victoria. As her older brother, I've always had a close relationship with her and I tease her quite a bit about a lot of things. She usually likes it and laughs along with everybody else. \\n\\nVictoria has been a playgirl since she was a teen. She has't really changed this pattern of her through the years. Not even after getting a high-end job that requires orofessionalism at its best. She's still the playgirl. And I tease her about this at family gatherings. She embraces that side of her and it's completely okay. She has even mentioned a few times that this is much better than our parents pressuring her to settle down.\\n\\nLast week, my mom invited Victoria and I over for my dad's birthday, along with my wife and son. I was surprised to see that Victoria had a girl with her. She introduced Rose (24F) as her date. I'm totally okay with Vic being bi. \\n\\nDuring the celebration, I cracked a few jokes about Victoria being a playgirl 'back in the day'. Jokes were harmless, mostly like 'oh come on half of your high school class were your ex', or 'were any of my friends not your boyfriend at some point' and similar stuff.\\n\\nIt was mostly received well and everyone laughed, even Vic. We were all having a very good time. I went to the kitchen to get my son something and Vic followed me. She told me I needed to shut up, that she was hardly controlling her temper and that I was ruining the night.\\n\\nI was like does Rose think she's your first? And she got mad she said what she talked about with Rose was pvriate but that I needed to stop making these comments right now. Even Rose laughed and was having a good time so I don't really understand.\\n\\nI told Vic I wouldn't do it anymore but she said the damage was done. I mean everyone really likes Vic, she's a natural charmer. And she's not gonna change overnight. So was what I did over the limit?\n",

I usually come home once every 2 months or so. I wouldn't play games at campus since I would be really busy so the only time I play games is when I get home. Normally, my parents hate seeing any sort of gadgets in our hands so me playing games in front of them is already a mistake. for context, we're staying temporarily in a 3 bedroom apartment since our house is being renovated so I had to share a room with my sister since the master bedroom is my parents' room and the 3rd room was the storage room. because of this, my study table is in the living room so there is where I play my games. yesterday, for the first time in so long I played games on my mom's laptop. you may ask why my mom's laptop well it's because both my parents each broke a laptop of mine. and that's because they hated that I played games. anyways, my mom wasn't home and I just started playing and I see a light flash behind me, I turn around to see my sister holding up her phone. I asked her what she did and she replied saying \"oh nothing I just took a picture to show mom that you're playing games on her laptop\". I didn't think much of it and only played for another 10 minutes. then, my mom comes home and starts shouting and screaming at me, calling me all kinds of names and wishing all kinds of things at me for playing video games. well at that moment words didn't come out of my mouth I just stood there dumbfounded then turned to my sister and saw her smirking. I just stayed silent, I mean there's nothing for me to say but after that I just didn't speak to neither of them.\n",

Max was 4 at the time of adoption, and the adoption agency let her know that he was timid and not good with children. He is about 40lbs, and looks to be a cattle dog mix. \\n\\nWhen I met Max, it was immediately clear that he would benefit greatly from training. This dog barked very loudly as soon as I walked in, cowers against my mom at all times, wanders listlessly and cries whenever she leaves, and whenever I walked out of my room would bark aggressively, and once rushed up to me barking and growling. I told her he needed training, but no, she says he would never bite. \\n\\nShortly after, he snapped at her friends young daughter when they met on a walk. I insisted he get training, but no, he is just a sweet baby and she doesn’t have children so there’s not an issue. \\n\\nNow we are all together for the holidays. My husband hugged me while my mother took our picture, and Max ran up to me and grabbed my pant leg and ripped it off from the knee down. Oh no, he thought I was being hurt and was protecting me! Literally 30 minutes later he snapped at my cousin as she walked past and caught her skirt. \\n\\nMy grandparents have called me anti dog, my mom has accused me of not liking max, and says things like “oh I’m sorry max, OP just doesn’t like you!” But like… I am not against dogs. I am a firm believer in dogs receiving training that they need! I’m so afraid that he will get the wrong person and they will press charges. I have this sick feeling that this will end badly, but everyone thinks I’m just being a jerk who doesn’t like my moms beloved dog. \\n\\nI admit, I’m more of a cat person, but I would be all for Max if he wasn’t unpredictable and if I thought my mom was doing the bare minimum. My whole family loves this dog. So Reddit..  aita?\\n\\nTLDR: my mom has an unpredictable dog with a bite history that I refuse to overlook. Everyone else loves him and thinks he’s a sweet baby that doesn’t need training. Aita?\n",

But my Mom wanted to hold a small party with some food and kareoke so she could invite my friends over, even though I said I didn't want anything like that, but due to her insistence I was forced to oblige. When the day came, I had just gotten home from a sleep over, I was tired due to playing games all night with my cousins, so when I got home, my family was already getting prepared for the party later afternoon, and of course I was told to help set up. After a while I went to my room for some much needed rest and I was planning on just being by myself until the time arrives for the party to start, but until then everything was peace and quiet, like I had originally intended. But everytime I was about to dose off, my mom would order me around, and if I didn't, she would guilt trip me about how much she didn't get much sleep or how much effort they were putting in, due to me not wanting to feel like an ungrateful ass, I reluctantly get up from my bed and do what she asks. And due to that, I feel like my day is legitimately ruined, I would put in the bare minimum of assistance and I would always have a frown on my face. I'm grateful for what they're trying to do for me, but I never asked for any of this, I just wanted to do the things that I wanna do for once... Am I the asshole?\n",
       "80569    \\n\\nEdit: Boyfriend  insist I add that we've been together 8 years and that if this happened a month into our relationship, he agrees it would be psychotic, but what's a donut or two after 8 years. \\n\\nThis is so dumb but this is somehow one the bigger fights we've had. \\n\\nI bought a shitty donut earlier today after me and my boyfriend finished some Christmas shopping and had dinner. I bought one and we were gonna share it. We regularly share food.\\n\\nWe go to my parents house to pick up our dog and chill out a bit before going home. I'm in the bathroom, and my boyfriend starts eating my donut and telling me how bad it is, stale and there's no creme in it (it's a Boston creme). I tell him that there's no way he's eating my donut right now and to stop or at least save me some.\\n\\nHe eats the whole donut. \\n\\nI get out of the bathroom and I'm kinda upset I wanted some donut tonight, he's being silly and put himself in the ''corner'' in the kitchen pretending he's there out of shame. I'm upset and ask him if he really ate it and he makes a joke and says it was so bad and not worth the calories. \\n\\nI just wanted a donut so I tell him that and he should save me some. (He says he apologized here but I do not remember this.) We go back into the living room and my dad is telling me drop it and that I'm overreacting for no reason. My mom is telling my boyfriend to apologize just because it obviously bothered me and that reason enough to apologize. My mom was kind of condescing towards him and the vibe got tense. \\n\\nI don't want to start some dumb fight over nothing and so we say our goodbyes and leave. \\n\\nOn the way home I ask him to apologize and he says I'm making a big deal out of nothing and hugely overreacting. I say he's gaslitting me. Were both upset. \\n\\nWe get home and keep talking about it in circles. I just want an apology to end it and he starts yelling that I'm being a ''five year old\" and that I \"made a scene in front of your parents\" and that I'm \"overreacting so badly he doesn't recognize me\". I'm mad cause he's \"gaslighting me into thinking I'm wrong\" and \"yelling at me for no reason\" and \"it doesn't matter if the donut was bad or not at least half of it was mine\". Anyways he yells my feelings are hurt and we go to seperate rooms and chill out for a bit. \\n\\nLater we talk about it a bit and both apologize, but maintain that we are in the right. \\n\\nSo Reddit, who right in this extremely dumb fight?\\n\\nWe have both reviewed this post and agree with its facts. \\n\\nTLDR: \\nMe - mad he ate my donut because we were meant to share. Doesn't matter that it was a bad donut, it's the principle of the thing. \\n\\nHim - he claims he wouldn't have been mad if I ate 'the last oreo' as an example. And that I dragged it out for too long (meaning my anger cause it was just a donut.) He says that he felt singled out my by mom and that that's worst than the donut.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE : He bought me a box of 6 donuts the next day, my favorite ones. \\nAnd he apologized.\\nAll is good, but thanks Reddit!!\\n\n",

I explained that if it was nondenominational or Christian I would consider it but I don’t feel it’s fair to pressure me to compromise own morals when I wouldn’t expect the same of her. AITA?\\n\\nEdit: I should note as well we are all staying in a rental home together this weekend so the hour they will be at mass without me is the only hour I will *not* be spending quality time with them this weekend. \n",

       "Now, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well.

       "Here’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?</td>\n",

My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house’s. \\n\\nHere’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?</td>\n",

BASICALLY EVERYTHING IMPORTANT TO ME RN TO MAKE MONEY. Come to find out, it’s because my roommate is constantly touching my stuff and moving it around to clean. To which I understand, but usually people move stuff back to their normal spots, if it isn’t THEIR OWN STUFF. So, I tried talking to her about it, but like any sit-down convo with her, she thinks I’m personally attacking her. Ive tried multiple ways to talk to her about it and it just comes out to the same conclusion. In her words, “ You’re the child and you need to shut the fuck up”. When she said that, I lost it. I told her, “ At least I’m not touching other people shit and then blaming it on other people!”, which made her upset and cry to our neighbors, who are now telling me to apologize. \\nI will apologize, if it means a better friendship in the end. But guys, I’ve genuinely tried every single way possible.

She usually likes it and laughs along with everybody else. \\n\\nVictoria has been a playgirl since she was a teen. She has't really changed this pattern of her through the years. Not even after getting a high-end job that requires orofessionalism at its best. She's still the playgirl. And I tease her about this at family gatherings. She embraces that side of her and it's completely okay. She has even mentioned a few times that this is much better than our parents pressuring her to settle down.\\n\\nLast week, my mom invited Victoria and I over for my dad's birthday, along with my wife and son. I was surprised to see that Victoria had a girl with her. She introduced Rose (24F) as her date. I'm totally okay with Vic being bi. \\n\\nDuring the celebration, I cracked a few jokes about Victoria being a playgirl 'back in the day'. Jokes were harmless, mostly like 'oh come on half of your high school class were your ex', or 'were any of my friends not your boyfriend at some point' and similar stuff.\\n\\nIt was mostly received well and everyone laughed, even Vic. We were all having a very good time. I went to the kitchen to get my son something and Vic followed me. She told me I needed to shut up, that she was hardly controlling her temper and that I was ruining the night.\\n\\nI was like does Rose think she's your first? And she got mad she said what she talked about with Rose was pvriate but that I needed to stop making these comments right now. Even Rose laughed and was having a good time so I don't really understand.\\n\\nI told Vic I wouldn't do it anymore but she said the damage was done.

While we were there, we all talked about dates and who we would take. I don’t know that many boys so my best friend said I could take her brother 16 M (let’s call him Zak)  to prom. I was fine with the idea since we were close friends since we did many school activities together. I had mentioned to him later that month that I might ask him to prom if I couldn’t find any other dates. A month later, Sally asked me to help her find a dress. I found one for her and she bought it. When I asked her if she had an idea for a date, she said she knew of a person in mind. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Two weeks ago, I asked Zak if he could be my date for prom. Since we were already close friends, he said he would. Ever since then, Sally has been giving me the cold shoulder and has gotten into arguments with me over the littlest things. The other day Sally got her SAT scores and said that I only did better than her since I took them multiple times. (I took mine junior year). She has definitely has been talking less to me and even gives me a look when I mention anything about prom. When I’m not around she always tries to talk to Zak. I only know this cause of my friends that tell me. I don’t mind since I’m not dating Zak but she is really making it obvious that she’s going a little too far. Like she always tells Zak’a sister that she saw his earlier or that she needed to talk to him about something in on of her classes.

There is a clothing requirement, so the family has to buy the fabric she selected and find a seamstress/tailor to make our clothes for us (Nigerian custom)...also not pocket-friendly. She expected my siblings to figure out how to pay for the fabric even though they do not have the means. My sister ultimately said she would not go if they were forced to buy the fabric because they had more pressing things to spend the money on. I paid for it anyway, even though my sister told me not to. My sister wanted to bring a plus one, but my cousin said they would need to pay to get it (buy the fabric). She wants the family to have the same fabric.\\n\\nI got a text early this week that she is having a bridal shower at the end of the month, and I was invited, but unfortunately, I cannot go. This morning, I received a text from one of the bridesmaids saying she had permission from my cousin to ask several other people out of those invited to the bridal shower \"how we would be supporting the shower regarding the budget.\" I was immediately annoyed.\\n\\nAm I the a-hole who is ready to send the text that I do not want to be part of the bridal shower planning committee?</td>\n",

But with her moving into her own place I can now probably see her every other weekend if not every weekend. Recently I found out that a game I’ve been waiting over 12 years for is going to drop soon. I told her about how excited I was and that I would probably take the day off of work when it releases. At first she was fine with it but then she became upset. She said she didn’t appreciate the fact that I would take a day off for a video game but wouldn’t take a day off to come see her. I already have plane tickets to see her the weekend before the release date and the weekend after and she knows this. Honestly I would’ve booked more weekends but I can’t because she doesn’t know her schedule, which is understandable. I told her that if we were celebrating something I would have no problem taking a day or days off of work, but for me to take a day off just to hang around the house doesnt make sense. I guess I just dont understand the significance of me taking an extra day off of work when I already will be seeing her pretty much every weekend.  Btw she has never once asked me to take a day off to see her and actually encourages me to take late flights so that i dont miss work.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I (37M) am married to wife (29) with 1 child who's almost 1. \\n\\nBackground info: I work 6 days a week busting my ass off from 7 am to 7 pm in the emergency room doing surgeries (not going into details).\\n\\nOn a random day, I decide to turn on the baby monitor we have set up and it's almost 9 am and I see our son just randomly rolling around the crib. Since this incident, I've been regularly checking the monitor to see what's been going on. Seems like he usually wakes up around 8 am and rolls around the crib for almost an hour. \\n\\nSo then I  proceed to text my wife at 8 am. No response. I call her, no response. Later in the day I confront her about this and she says she has her own routine of doing things yada yada. This is when I said you either get up when the baby gets up or I hire a nanny. She lost it and started screaming all these obscenities at me and I'm sitting here saying I wake up close to 3 hours before you every day working my ass off bringing in income close to the top 1% and you can't even wake up before a baby? This blows my mind. \\n\\nSo reddit, aita?</td>\n",

I do admit, I did find someone at first but I realized my mistake and only dated the girl for legit a day before I realized my mistake and decided to become loyal to Roxy. She went after other guys and had multiple relationships so we didn't talk much for a while but were still friends.\\n\\nEver since I learned how to drive and got my car, we have hung out a whole lot more and sometimes it led to more (won't go into detail). Forgot to mention she is single but has made it VERY clear that she does not want a relationship other than friends with me. Once I came to the conclusion that she meant it, I started to do less and less for her.\\n\\nSo now it has come to today. She usually goes with her mom after work to clean offices for extra cash. Her mom recently had eye surgery on her right eye so her mom isn't feeling the best. Roxy is sick and doesn't feel well either and on top of that she's on her period. This is where I might be the Ahole. Roxy asked me to go to work with her today because she wasn't feeling the best and wanted some extra help. I told her I had worked at my job already Monday through Thursday and just wanted my days off which are Friday and Saturday. She tried to guilt trip me into going by telling me I would look terrible in front of her mom which is true I admit. I ended up not going and she tried to tell me she felt like sh!t and needed my help. I changed the subject and asked her about something else and she hasn't responded. So, AITA for deciding not to go to work with her despite her needing help?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I 26f have a business and one of my methods of payment is Venmo. The other day a former client (60sf) mistakenly sent me $100. Any transactions sent to a merchant account automatically have Venmo’s business fees applied- 1.9% + .10. This came out to 2 dollars. For one transaction it’s not all that bad but since I do so many transactions a year it adds up. I want to emphasize that I do NOT keep the business fee, it goes to venmo, only the $98 showed up in my account so that is what I sent her back. I told her beforehand that I would send back what I got after business fees but she was pretty pissed. I’m not really sure how it was mistakenly sent to me given I haven’t serviced her in close to a year, and because of this I don’t think it could be excused as just a slip of the thumb. I don’t feel like, even though it’s only $2, I should pay for this woman’s error. As Bob Belcher says, “it’s the principle of the thing!” I told her to contact venmo but she still wasn’t happy and threatened a bad review. AITA?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I (17 F) recently celebrated my older sister's (33 F, who I will call Ally ) birthday, my sister birthday was this past Thursday so to celebrate my other Sister who I will call June (26 F) put a \"night/late barbecue\" together and invited a few of my family and friends to come, eat and drink. Now I think it's important to mention the fact that earlier that day I fell on my way to University and due to a long medical history of ankle sprains and what not, my dad was very concerned. Now onto the context, I got back from University quite late since I had to go to my campus nurse to check con my ankle and picked my cousin on the way back since our driver asked me if that was okay and I accepted. When I got there there were a few people, there was my dad, aunt, dad's friend, June's boyfriend, Ally and June on the grill already cooking, I got there and went to my room to stay there since my dad insisted that I rest my ankle due to the fall. I could hear a few knocks on our door and heard a few more voices but I was concentrated trying to do other things. I did go downstairs for a glass of water and say hi to my cousins who joined us but that was that.  Now it´s important to mention that nor June or I are from the city we currently live in, we come from a small town that is quite different and I personally love that, my dad still lives in that city and brought me some dishes that I love, in my town we love to this dish eat alongside with barbecue, since I had a long day and was missing my town I decided to reheat that dish and serve it with barbecue to eat. I was happily eating in the kitchen while everyone was outside and even shared a little bit of this dish with another of my cousins when June came in and gave me a disapproving look, the very loudly said \"Are you seriously going to eat that when there is a lot of food left?\". I look at her dumbfounded ' cause i didn´t understand and continued eating while she made more comments on her way out. I finished eating and proceeded to ask  Ally if she knew why June was so mad about me eating, Ally told me that June had actually invited more people than there actually was so she calculated and cooked a larger portion than needed therefore there was a LOT of remaining food. I didn´t know that and I guess I could have eaten a bit more but probably would have still eaten the dish since 1. It´s my favorite and 2. It´s made mainly with rice and various condiments which meant it could go bad at any second and i didn´t want that to happen. My dad and Ally reassured me that I did nothing wrong but June has been acting mean and cold towards me so I have really been overthinking. So people of Reddit, AITA?</td>\n",

So all of my husband’s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\\n\\nI’ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we’ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she’s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house’s. \\n\\nHere’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?  \n",

I’ve been getting really frustrated recently, because everything in the apartment is constantly getting moved around, and its annoying to constantly look for my things, including my server book, my work shoes, and my ipad to finish projects. BASICALLY EVERYTHING IMPORTANT TO ME RN TO MAKE MONEY. Come to find out, it’s because my roommate is constantly touching my stuff and moving it around to clean. To which I understand, but usually people move stuff back to their normal spots, if it isn’t THEIR OWN STUFF. So, I tried talking to her about it, but like any sit-down convo with her, she thinks I’m personally attacking her. Ive tried multiple ways to talk to her about it and it just comes out to the same conclusion. In her words, “ You’re the child and you need to shut the fuck up”. When she said that, I lost it. I told her, “ At least I’m not touching other people shit and then blaming it on other people!”, which made her upset and cry to our neighbors, who are now telling me to apologize. \\nI will apologize, if it means a better friendship in the end. But guys, I’ve genuinely tried every single way possible. AITA?\\n\\n\\n\\nQUICK EDIT: Just to lyk i basically live in the living room area. but my space is very well defined ( basically yk what part is bedroom and what part is the living room) Ive very OCD about my stuff and keep very tidy. I don’t leave anything in her way or anything like that. I’m a people pleaser and I try not to make anyone upset or uncomfortable in their own home. I leave my important things on my nightstand, thats away from the living room area.  \n",

This turned out to be much more serious than it should have been in my opinion. I'm wondering what the internet thinks. So here it goes.\\n\\nI (32M) have a younger sister (29F) Victoria. As her older brother, I've always had a close relationship with her and I tease her quite a bit about a lot of things. She usually likes it and laughs along with everybody else. \\n\\nVictoria has been a playgirl since she was a teen. She has't really changed this pattern of her through the years. Not even after getting a high-end job that requires orofessionalism at its best. She's still the playgirl. And I tease her about this at family gatherings. She embraces that side of her and it's completely okay. She has even mentioned a few times that this is much better than our parents pressuring her to settle down.\\n\\nLast week, my mom invited Victoria and I over for my dad's birthday, along with my wife and son. I was surprised to see that Victoria had a girl with her. She introduced Rose (24F) as her date. I'm totally okay with Vic being bi. \\n\\nDuring the celebration, I cracked a few jokes about Victoria being a playgirl 'back in the day'. Jokes were harmless, mostly like 'oh come on half of your high school class were your ex', or 'were any of my friends not your boyfriend at some point' and similar stuff.\\n\\nIt was mostly received well and everyone laughed, even Vic. We were all having a very good time. I went to the kitchen to get my son something and Vic followed me. She told me I needed to shut up, that she was hardly controlling her temper and that I was ruining the night.\\n\\nI was like does Rose think she's your first? And she got mad she said what she talked about with Rose was pvriate but that I needed to stop making these comments right now. Even Rose laughed and was having a good time so I don't really understand.\\n\\nI told Vic I wouldn't do it anymore but she said the damage was done. I mean everyone really likes Vic, she's a natural charmer. And she's not gonna change overnight. So was what I did over the limit?  \n",

Two months ago, my senior friend group and I went dress shopping. While we were there, we all talked about dates and who we would take. I don’t know that many boys so my best friend said I could take her brother 16 M (let’s call him Zak)  to prom. I was fine with the idea since we were close friends since we did many school activities together. I had mentioned to him later that month that I might ask him to prom if I couldn’t find any other dates. A month later, Sally asked me to help her find a dress. I found one for her and she bought it. When I asked her if she had an idea for a date, she said she knew of a person in mind. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Two weeks ago, I asked Zak if he could be my date for prom. Since we were already close friends, he said he would. Ever since then, Sally has been giving me the cold shoulder and has gotten into arguments with me over the littlest things. The other day Sally got her SAT scores and said that I only did better than her since I took them multiple times. (I took mine junior year). She has definitely has been talking less to me and even gives me a look when I mention anything about prom. When I’m not around she always tries to talk to Zak. I only know this cause of my friends that tell me. I don’t mind since I’m not dating Zak but she is really making it obvious that she’s going a little too far. Like she always tells Zak’a sister that she saw his earlier or that she needed to talk to him about something in on of her classes. I don’t know if I’m overreacting but I really want to confront Sally about it. I really want to keep our friendship since we have so many things in common but I guess it’s going to break apart. Was I the AH in this situation?  \n",

I (38F) came to America to live with her family when I was 6; needless to say, her parents were abusive. My cousin and I were never close and were mean to each other; she would call me \"immigrant\" and taunt me by saying, \"E.T. phone home\" because I had to call my family back in Nigeria. We constantly fought while I was living with her family.\\n\\nFor my wedding and as a guest, she was late for the wedding and left relatively early during the reception. No gifts. No card. Nothing. I did not care, even though my husband commented years later. I do not get happy birthday texts from her, but I get spammed with text messages reminding me that hers is coming soon.\\n\\nShe cannot have the wedding in the US because her fiance does not have the paperwork, so we all have to go to Nigeria for her wedding... and the price is not pocket-friendly. There is a clothing requirement, so the family has to buy the fabric she selected and find a seamstress/tailor to make our clothes for us (Nigerian custom)...also not pocket-friendly. She expected my siblings to figure out how to pay for the fabric even though they do not have the means. My sister ultimately said she would not go if they were forced to buy the fabric because they had more pressing things to spend the money on. I paid for it anyway, even though my sister told me not to. My sister wanted to bring a plus one, but my cousin said they would need to pay to get it (buy the fabric). She wants the family to have the same fabric.\\n\\nI got a text early this week that she is having a bridal shower at the end of the month, and I was invited, but unfortunately, I cannot go. This morning, I received a text from one of the bridesmaids saying she had permission from my cousin to ask several other people out of those invited to the bridal shower \"how we would be supporting the shower regarding the budget.\" I was immediately annoyed.\\n\\nAm I the a-hole who is ready to send the text that I do not want to be part of the bridal shower planning committee?  \n",

She recently moved into her own place so now we live about 13.5 hours away from each other. At the minimum we try to see each other once a month for about 2-3 days. But with her moving into her own place I can now probably see her every other weekend if not every weekend. Recently I found out that a game I’ve been waiting over 12 years for is going to drop soon. I told her about how excited I was and that I would probably take the day off of work when it releases. At first she was fine with it but then she became upset. She said she didn’t appreciate the fact that I would take a day off for a video game but wouldn’t take a day off to come see her. I already have plane tickets to see her the weekend before the release date and the weekend after and she knows this. Honestly I would’ve booked more weekends but I can’t because she doesn’t know her schedule, which is understandable. I told her that if we were celebrating something I would have no problem taking a day or days off of work, but for me to take a day off just to hang around the house doesnt make sense. I guess I just dont understand the significance of me taking an extra day off of work when I already will be seeing her pretty much every weekend.  Btw she has never once asked me to take a day off to see her and actually encourages me to take late flights so that i dont miss work.  \n",

Since this incident, I've been regularly checking the monitor to see what's been going on. Seems like he usually wakes up around 8 am and rolls around the crib for almost an hour. \\n\\nSo then I  proceed to text my wife at 8 am. No response. I call her, no response. Later in the day I confront her about this and she says she has her own routine of doing things yada yada. This is when I said you either get up when the baby gets up or I hire a nanny.

We were still friends after we \"took a break\". I do admit, I did find someone at first but I realized my mistake and only dated the girl for legit a day before I realized my mistake and decided to become loyal to Roxy. She went after other guys and had multiple relationships so we didn't talk much for a while but were still friends.\\n\\nEver since I learned how to drive and got my car, we have hung out a whole lot more and sometimes it led to more (won't go into detail). Forgot to mention she is single but has made it VERY clear that she does not want a relationship other than friends with me. Once I came to the conclusion that she meant it, I started to do less and less for her.\\n\\nSo now it has come to today. She usually goes with her mom after work to clean offices for extra cash. Her mom recently had eye surgery on her right eye so her mom isn't feeling the best. Roxy is sick and doesn't feel well either and on top of that she's on her period. This is where I might be the Ahole. Roxy asked me to go to work with her today because she wasn't feeling the best and wanted some extra help. I told her I had worked at my job already Monday through Thursday and just wanted my days off which are Friday and Saturday. She tried to guilt trip me into going by telling me I would look terrible in front of her mom which is true I admit. I ended up not going and she tried to tell me she felt like sh!t and needed my help. I changed the subject and asked her about something else and she hasn't responded. So, AITA for deciding not to go to work with her despite her needing help?  \n",

The other day a former client (60sf) mistakenly sent me $100. Any transactions sent to a merchant account automatically have Venmo’s business fees applied- 1.9% + .10. This came out to 2 dollars. For one transaction it’s not all that bad but since I do so many transactions a year it adds up. I want to emphasize that I do NOT keep the business fee, it goes to venmo, only the $98 showed up in my account so that is what I sent her back. I told her beforehand that I would send back what I got after business fees but she was pretty pissed. I’m not really sure how it was mistakenly sent to me given I haven’t serviced her in close to a year, and because of this I don’t think it could be excused as just a slip of the thumb. I don’t feel like, even though it’s only $2, I should pay for this woman’s error. As Bob Belcher says, “it’s the principle of the thing!” I told her to contact venmo but she still wasn’t happy and threatened a bad review. AITA?  \n",
       "25  I (17 F) recently celebrated my older sister's (33 F, who I will call Ally ) birthday, my sister birthday was this past Thursday so to celebrate my other Sister who I will call June (26 F) put a \"night/late barbecue\" together and invited a few of my family and friends to come, eat and drink. Now I think it's important to mention the fact that earlier that day I fell on my way to University and due to a long medical history of ankle sprains and what not, my dad was very concerned. Now onto the context, I got back from University quite late since I had to go to my campus nurse to check con my ankle and picked my cousin on the way back since our driver asked me if that was okay and I accepted. When I got there there were a few people, there was my dad, aunt, dad's friend, June's boyfriend, Ally and June on the grill already cooking, I got there and went to my room to stay there since my dad insisted that I rest my ankle due to the fall. I could hear a few knocks on our door and heard a few more voices but I was concentrated trying to do other things. I did go downstairs for a glass of water and say hi to my cousins who joined us but that was that.  Now it´s important to mention that nor June or I are from the city we currently live in, we come from a small town that is quite different and I personally love that, my dad still lives in that city and brought me some dishes that I love, in my town we love to this dish eat alongside with barbecue, since I had a long day and was missing my town I decided to reheat that dish and serve it with barbecue to eat. I was happily eating in the kitchen while everyone was outside and even shared a little bit of this dish with another of my cousins when June came in and gave me a disapproving look, the very loudly said \"Are you seriously going to eat that when there is a lot of food left?\". I look at her dumbfounded ' cause i didn´t understand and continued eating while she made more comments on her way out. I finished eating and proceeded to ask  Ally if she knew why June was so mad about me eating, Ally told me that June had actually invited more people than there actually was so she calculated and cooked a larger portion than needed therefore there was a LOT of remaining food. I didn´t know that and I guess I could have eaten a bit more but probably would have still eaten the dish since 1. It´s my favorite and 2. It´s made mainly with rice and various condiments which meant it could go bad at any second and i didn´t want that to happen. My dad and Ally reassured me that I did nothing wrong but June has been acting mean and cold towards me so I have really been overthinking. So people of Reddit, AITA?  "

My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house’s. \\n\\nHere’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?</td>\n",

Well she didn't say that they weren't for everyone amd since she frequently goes grocery shopping for my mom I thought they were for everyone so I ate one today.  She goes and asks my little sister (14) if she had them, she says no so my sister comes in my room while I'm trying to sleep (the box for the cookies were in my trash can because there was one left and I'm not dirtying a dish if i don't have to.

I said that I'd pay for the single cookie I took she refused.  So she goes and says she's not leaving my room until I give her $5 so I call my mom and my mom tells her to get out of my room. She ends up saying that she'll wait until I go to school on monday (I'm 16 so still in hs)  so she can steal my stuff to pay for the box (she's done this before when I didn't know that the ice cream in the freezer was hers and she stole my $100 hair straighter that I had to break into her room to get back) I tell her to get out again and she does. But not before she goes and kicks my cats food bowl and threatens to dump her litter box out.\\n\\nAnd earlier today she was also complaining about my other older sister (21) getting mad at her for eating a donut that she bought and she thought they were for everyone.

BASICALLY EVERYTHING IMPORTANT TO ME RN TO MAKE MONEY. Come to find out, it’s because my roommate is constantly touching my stuff and moving it around to clean.

So, I tried talking to her about it, but like any sit-down convo with her, she thinks I’m personally attacking her. Ive tried multiple ways to talk to her about it and it just comes out to the same conclusion. In her words, “ You’re the child and you need to shut the fuck up”. When she said that, I lost it. I told her, “ At least I’m not touching other people shit and then blaming it on other people!”, which made her upset and cry to our neighbors, who are now telling me to apologize. \\nI will apologize, if it means a better friendship in the end.

She usually likes it and laughs along with everybody else. \\n\\nVictoria has been a playgirl since she was a teen. She has't really changed this pattern of her through the years. Not even after getting a high-end job that requires orofessionalism at its best. She's still the playgirl. And I tease her about this at family gatherings. She embraces that side of her and it's completely okay. She has even mentioned a few times that this is much better than our parents pressuring her to settle down.\\n\\nLast week, my mom invited Victoria and I over for my dad's birthday, along with my wife and son. I was surprised to see that Victoria had a girl with her. She introduced Rose (24F) as her date. I'm totally okay with Vic being bi. \\n\\nDuring the celebration, I cracked a few jokes about Victoria being a playgirl 'back in the day'. Jokes were harmless, mostly like 'oh come on half of your high school class were your ex', or 'were any of my friends not your boyfriend at some point' and similar stuff.\\n\\nIt was mostly received well and everyone laughed, even Vic. We were all having a very good time. I went to the kitchen to get my son something and Vic followed me. She told me I needed to shut up, that she was hardly controlling her temper and that I was ruining the night.\\n\\nI was like does Rose think she's your first? And she got mad she said what she talked about with Rose was pvriate but that I needed to stop making these comments right now. Even Rose laughed and was having a good time so I don't really understand.\\n\\nI told Vic I wouldn't do it anymore but she said the damage was done.

While we were there, we all talked about dates and who we would take. I don’t know that many boys so my best friend said I could take her brother 16 M (let’s call him Zak)  to prom. I was fine with the idea since we were close friends since we did many school activities together. I had mentioned to him later that month that I might ask him to prom if I couldn’t find any other dates. A month later, Sally asked me to help her find a dress. I found one for her and she bought it. When I asked her if she had an idea for a date, she said she knew of a person in mind. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Two weeks ago, I asked Zak if he could be my date for prom. Since we were already close friends, he said he would. Ever since then, Sally has been giving me the cold shoulder and has gotten into arguments with me over the littlest things. The other day Sally got her SAT scores and said that I only did better than her since I took them multiple times. (I took mine junior year). She has definitely has been talking less to me and even gives me a look when I mention anything about prom. When I’m not around she always tries to talk to Zak. I only know this cause of my friends that tell me. I don’t mind since I’m not dating Zak but she is really making it obvious that she’s going a little too far. Like she always tells Zak’a sister that she saw his earlier or that she needed to talk to him about something in on of her classes.

There is a clothing requirement, so the family has to buy the fabric she selected and find a seamstress/tailor to make our clothes for us (Nigerian custom)...also not pocket-friendly. She expected my siblings to figure out how to pay for the fabric even though they do not have the means. My sister ultimately said she would not go if they were forced to buy the fabric because they had more pressing things to spend the money on. I paid for it anyway, even though my sister told me not to. My sister wanted to bring a plus one, but my cousin said they would need to pay to get it (buy the fabric). She wants the family to have the same fabric.\\n\\nI got a text early this week that she is having a bridal shower at the end of the month, and I was invited, but unfortunately, I cannot go. This morning, I received a text from one of the bridesmaids saying she had permission from my cousin to ask several other people out of those invited to the bridal shower \"how we would be supporting the shower regarding the budget.\" I was immediately annoyed.\\n\\nAm I the a-hole who is ready to send the text that I do not want to be part of the bridal shower planning committee?</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I (F23) have been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend (F22) for 5 months. She recently moved into her own place so now we live about 13.5 hours away from each other. At the minimum we try to see each other once a month for about 2-3 days. But with her moving into her own place I can now probably see her every other weekend if not every weekend. Recently I found out that a game I’ve been waiting over 12 years for is going to drop soon. I told her about how excited I was and that I would probably take the day off of work when it releases. At first she was fine with it but then she became upset. She said she didn’t appreciate the fact that I would take a day off for a video game but wouldn’t take a day off to come see her. I already have plane tickets to see her the weekend before the release date and the weekend after and she knows this. Honestly I would’ve booked more weekends but I can’t because she doesn’t know her schedule, which is understandable. I told her that if we were celebrating something I would have no problem taking a day or days off of work, but for me to take a day off just to hang around the house doesnt make sense. I guess I just dont understand the significance of me taking an extra day off of work when I already will be seeing her pretty much every weekend.  Btw she has never once asked me to take a day off to see her and actually encourages me to take late flights so that i dont miss work.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This happened a few weeks ago but it’s been on my mind as I’m not sure if I handled it correctly.\\n\\nJust for context, she left me for someone i once considered a brother. After she left she took my daughter with her and I wasn’t able to see her for almost 6 months and since she moved to a different state, I had to quickly gather the money for a lawyer and drag her back to my state before my daughter became a legal citizen of the other state where I would have to get a lawyer in that state. \\n\\nI have custody of my daughter now but I still want her to have a relationship with her mother. So I told her mother that she could video call me 2 times per week. And I don’t want him around my daughter nor do I want him seeing my daughter even through the video call as I’ve never really trusted him as he is a S.O. And I don’t know the specifics of his charge other than it was statutory R.\\n\\nI now have a loving girlfriend and I don’t think I could ask for a better mate. She treats me and my daughter amazingly. Even though she says she doesn’t like children she still goes out of her way to get things like clothes and toys for mine. However, she’s been abundantly clear that she doesn’t want to be a step mother even though in some ways she’s tip toed around the role.\\n\\nSo now that you are all caught up, I can finally talk to you about the call in question. The call was going relatively well but at this point I was already a little upset with her over her insistence that she allows my daughter to be around her new boyfriend which has and always will remain a fat NO. But at one point in the call I’m trying to adjust the baby so she can see her mother better and vice versa. And she sees a glimpse of my gf. And then she said the comment that really pissed me off for several reasons. “So do you have a new woman play step mom to my daughter?” And I lost it from that point. I told her to not say shit like that especially after she abandoned what we built together. And I made it abundantly clear on how my gf felt about how she DIDNT want to be called or considered a step mother. She wanted to ask me a few questions that I quickly shot down as I’m still upset at the fact that she kept me in the dark about my daughter for 6 months. \\n\\nAt this point I was tired of her shit so maybe It was too much. But I feel like she lost the right to know what is happening in my love life the second that she cheated on me and left with my child in the middle of the night. So AITA?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I (37M) am married to wife (29) with 1 child who's almost 1. \\n\\nBackground info: I work 6 days a week busting my ass off from 7 am to 7 pm in the emergency room doing surgeries (not going into details).\\n\\nOn a random day, I decide to turn on the baby monitor we have set up and it's almost 9 am and I see our son just randomly rolling around the crib. Since this incident, I've been regularly checking the monitor to see what's been going on. Seems like he usually wakes up around 8 am and rolls around the crib for almost an hour. \\n\\nSo then I  proceed to text my wife at 8 am. No response. I call her, no response. Later in the day I confront her about this and she says she has her own routine of doing things yada yada. This is when I said you either get up when the baby gets up or I hire a nanny. She lost it and started screaming all these obscenities at me and I'm sitting here saying I wake up close to 3 hours before you every day working my ass off bringing in income close to the top 1% and you can't even wake up before a baby? This blows my mind. \\n\\nSo reddit, aita?</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n\\nFor some context, I (20M) have this friend (20F, we'll call her Roxy) who I dated back in middle school. We were still friends after we \"took a break\". I do admit, I did find someone at first but I realized my mistake and only dated the girl for legit a day before I realized my mistake and decided to become loyal to Roxy. She went after other guys and had multiple relationships so we didn't talk much for a while but were still friends.\\n\\nEver since I learned how to drive and got my car, we have hung out a whole lot more and sometimes it led to more (won't go into detail). Forgot to mention she is single but has made it VERY clear that she does not want a relationship other than friends with me. Once I came to the conclusion that she meant it, I started to do less and less for her.\\n\\nSo now it has come to today. She usually goes with her mom after work to clean offices for extra cash. Her mom recently had eye surgery on her right eye so her mom isn't feeling the best. Roxy is sick and doesn't feel well either and on top of that she's on her period. This is where I might be the Ahole. Roxy asked me to go to work with her today because she wasn't feeling the best and wanted some extra help. I told her I had worked at my job already Monday through Thursday and just wanted my days off which are Friday and Saturday. She tried to guilt trip me into going by telling me I would look terrible in front of her mom which is true I admit. I ended up not going and she tried to tell me she felt like sh!t and needed my help. I changed the subject and asked her about something else and she hasn't responded. So, AITA for deciding not to go to work with her despite her needing help?</td>\n",

So all of my husband’s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\\n\\nI’ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we’ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she’s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house’s. \\n\\nHere’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?  \n",

They were $5 for a 8 pack. Well she didn't say that they weren't for everyone amd since she frequently goes grocery shopping for my mom I thought they were for everyone so I ate one today.  She goes and asks my little sister (14) if she had them, she says no so my sister comes in my room while I'm trying to sleep (the box for the cookies were in my trash can because there was one left and I'm not dirtying a dish if i don't have to. Well she sees it amd takes it out of the trash and throws at me which woke me up. She tells me that she wants me to pay for the whole box because her kid is sad she didn't get the last cookie. I said that I'd pay for the single cookie I took she refused.  So she goes and says she's not leaving my room until I give her $5 so I call my mom and my mom tells her to get out of my room. She ends up saying that she'll wait until I go to school on monday (I'm 16 so still in hs)  so she can steal my stuff to pay for the box (she's done this before when I didn't know that the ice cream in the freezer was hers and she stole my $100 hair straighter that I had to break into her room to get back) I tell her to get out again and she does.

I’ve been getting really frustrated recently, because everything in the apartment is constantly getting moved around, and its annoying to constantly look for my things, including my server book, my work shoes, and my ipad to finish projects. BASICALLY EVERYTHING IMPORTANT TO ME RN TO MAKE MONEY. Come to find out, it’s because my roommate is constantly touching my stuff and moving it around to clean. To which I understand, but usually people move stuff back to their normal spots, if it isn’t THEIR OWN STUFF. So, I tried talking to her about it, but like any sit-down convo with her, she thinks I’m personally attacking her. Ive tried multiple ways to talk to her about it and it just comes out to the same conclusion. In her words, “ You’re the child and you need to shut the fuck up”. When she said that, I lost it. I told her, “ At least I’m not touching other people shit and then blaming it on other people!”, which made her upset and cry to our neighbors, who are now telling me to apologize. \\nI will apologize, if it means a better friendship in the end. But guys, I’ve genuinely tried every single way possible. AITA?\\n\\n\\n\\nQUICK EDIT: Just to lyk i basically live in the living room area. but my space is very well defined ( basically yk what part is bedroom and what part is the living room) Ive very OCD about my stuff and keep very tidy. I don’t leave anything in her way or anything like that. I’m a people pleaser and I try not to make anyone upset or uncomfortable in their own home. I leave my important things on my nightstand, thats away from the living room area.  \n",

This turned out to be much more serious than it should have been in my opinion. I'm wondering what the internet thinks. So here it goes.\\n\\nI (32M) have a younger sister (29F) Victoria. As her older brother, I've always had a close relationship with her and I tease her quite a bit about a lot of things. She usually likes it and laughs along with everybody else. \\n\\nVictoria has been a playgirl since she was a teen. She has't really changed this pattern of her through the years. Not even after getting a high-end job that requires orofessionalism at its best. She's still the playgirl. And I tease her about this at family gatherings. She embraces that side of her and it's completely okay. She has even mentioned a few times that this is much better than our parents pressuring her to settle down.\\n\\nLast week, my mom invited Victoria and I over for my dad's birthday, along with my wife and son. I was surprised to see that Victoria had a girl with her. She introduced Rose (24F) as her date. I'm totally okay with Vic being bi. \\n\\nDuring the celebration, I cracked a few jokes about Victoria being a playgirl 'back in the day'. Jokes were harmless, mostly like 'oh come on half of your high school class were your ex', or 'were any of my friends not your boyfriend at some point' and similar stuff.\\n\\nIt was mostly received well and everyone laughed, even Vic. We were all having a very good time. I went to the kitchen to get my son something and Vic followed me. She told me I needed to shut up, that she was hardly controlling her temper and that I was ruining the night.\\n\\nI was like does Rose think she's your first? And she got mad she said what she talked about with Rose was pvriate but that I needed to stop making these comments right now. Even Rose laughed and was having a good time so I don't really understand.\\n\\nI told Vic I wouldn't do it anymore but she said the damage was done. I mean everyone really likes Vic, she's a natural charmer. And she's not gonna change overnight. So was what I did over the limit?  \n",

Two months ago, my senior friend group and I went dress shopping. While we were there, we all talked about dates and who we would take. I don’t know that many boys so my best friend said I could take her brother 16 M (let’s call him Zak)  to prom. I was fine with the idea since we were close friends since we did many school activities together. I had mentioned to him later that month that I might ask him to prom if I couldn’t find any other dates. A month later, Sally asked me to help her find a dress. I found one for her and she bought it. When I asked her if she had an idea for a date, she said she knew of a person in mind. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Two weeks ago, I asked Zak if he could be my date for prom. Since we were already close friends, he said he would. Ever since then, Sally has been giving me the cold shoulder and has gotten into arguments with me over the littlest things. The other day Sally got her SAT scores and said that I only did better than her since I took them multiple times. (I took mine junior year). She has definitely has been talking less to me and even gives me a look when I mention anything about prom. When I’m not around she always tries to talk to Zak. I only know this cause of my friends that tell me. I don’t mind since I’m not dating Zak but she is really making it obvious that she’s going a little too far. Like she always tells Zak’a sister that she saw his earlier or that she needed to talk to him about something in on of her classes. I don’t know if I’m overreacting but I really want to confront Sally about it. I really want to keep our friendship since we have so many things in common but I guess it’s going to break apart. Was I the AH in this situation?  \n",

I (38F) came to America to live with her family when I was 6; needless to say, her parents were abusive. My cousin and I were never close and were mean to each other; she would call me \"immigrant\" and taunt me by saying, \"E.T. phone home\" because I had to call my family back in Nigeria. We constantly fought while I was living with her family.\\n\\nFor my wedding and as a guest, she was late for the wedding and left relatively early during the reception. No gifts. No card. Nothing. I did not care, even though my husband commented years later. I do not get happy birthday texts from her, but I get spammed with text messages reminding me that hers is coming soon.\\n\\nShe cannot have the wedding in the US because her fiance does not have the paperwork, so we all have to go to Nigeria for her wedding... and the price is not pocket-friendly. There is a clothing requirement, so the family has to buy the fabric she selected and find a seamstress/tailor to make our clothes for us (Nigerian custom)...also not pocket-friendly. She expected my siblings to figure out how to pay for the fabric even though they do not have the means. My sister ultimately said she would not go if they were forced to buy the fabric because they had more pressing things to spend the money on. I paid for it anyway, even though my sister told me not to. My sister wanted to bring a plus one, but my cousin said they would need to pay to get it (buy the fabric). She wants the family to have the same fabric.\\n\\nI got a text early this week that she is having a bridal shower at the end of the month, and I was invited, but unfortunately, I cannot go. This morning, I received a text from one of the bridesmaids saying she had permission from my cousin to ask several other people out of those invited to the bridal shower \"how we would be supporting the shower regarding the budget.\" I was immediately annoyed.\\n\\nAm I the a-hole who is ready to send the text that I do not want to be part of the bridal shower planning committee?  \n",

She recently moved into her own place so now we live about 13.5 hours away from each other. At the minimum we try to see each other once a month for about 2-3 days. But with her moving into her own place I can now probably see her every other weekend if not every weekend. Recently I found out that a game I’ve been waiting over 12 years for is going to drop soon. I told her about how excited I was and that I would probably take the day off of work when it releases. At first she was fine with it but then she became upset. She said she didn’t appreciate the fact that I would take a day off for a video game but wouldn’t take a day off to come see her. I already have plane tickets to see her the weekend before the release date and the weekend after and she knows this. Honestly I would’ve booked more weekends but I can’t because she doesn’t know her schedule, which is understandable. I told her that if we were celebrating something I would have no problem taking a day or days off of work, but for me to take a day off just to hang around the house doesnt make sense. I guess I just dont understand the significance of me taking an extra day off of work when I already will be seeing her pretty much every weekend.  Btw she has never once asked me to take a day off to see her and actually encourages me to take late flights so that i dont miss work.  \n",
       "16  This happened a few weeks ago but it’s been on my mind as I’m not sure if I handled it correctly.\\n\\nJust for context, she left me for someone i once considered a brother. After she left she took my daughter with her and I wasn’t able to see her for almost 6 months and since she moved to a different state, I had to quickly gather the money for a lawyer and drag her back to my state before my daughter became a legal citizen of the other state where I would have to get a lawyer in that state. \\n\\nI have custody of my daughter now but I still want her to have a relationship with her mother. So I told her mother that she could video call me 2 times per week. And I don’t want him around my daughter nor do I want him seeing my daughter even through the video call as I’ve never really trusted him as he is a S.O. And I don’t know the specifics of his charge other than it was statutory R.\\n\\nI now have a loving girlfriend and I don’t think I could ask for a better mate. She treats me and my daughter amazingly. Even though she says she doesn’t like children she still goes out of her way to get things like clothes and toys for mine. However, she’s been abundantly clear that she doesn’t want to be a step mother even though in some ways she’s tip toed around the role.\\n\\nSo now that you are all caught up, I can finally talk to you about the call in question. The call was going relatively well but at this point I was already a little upset with her over her insistence that she allows my daughter to be around her new boyfriend which has and always will remain a fat NO. But at one point in the call I’m trying to adjust the baby so she can see her mother better and vice versa. And she sees a glimpse of my gf. And then she said the comment that really pissed me off for several reasons. “So do you have a new woman play step mom to my daughter?” And I lost it from that point. I told her to not say shit like that especially after she abandoned what we built together. And I made it abundantly clear on how my gf felt about how she DIDNT want to be called or considered a step mother. She wanted to ask me a few questions that I quickly shot down as I’m still upset at the fact that she kept me in the dark about my daughter for 6 months. \\n\\nAt this point I was tired of her shit so maybe It was too much. But I feel like she lost the right to know what is happening in my love life the second that she cheated on me and left with my child in the middle of the night. So AITA?  \n",

Later in the day I confront her about this and she says she has her own routine of doing things yada yada. This is when I said you either get up when the baby gets up or I hire a nanny.

We were still friends after we \"took a break\". I do admit, I did find someone at first but I realized my mistake and only dated the girl for legit a day before I realized my mistake and decided to become loyal to Roxy. She went after other guys and had multiple relationships so we didn't talk much for a while but were still friends.\\n\\nEver since I learned how to drive and got my car, we have hung out a whole lot more and sometimes it led to more (won't go into detail). Forgot to mention she is single but has made it VERY clear that she does not want a relationship other than friends with me. Once I came to the conclusion that she meant it, I started to do less and less for her.\\n\\nSo now it has come to today. She usually goes with her mom after work to clean offices for extra cash. Her mom recently had eye surgery on her right eye so her mom isn't feeling the best. Roxy is sick and doesn't feel well either and on top of that she's on her period. This is where I might be the Ahole. Roxy asked me to go to work with her today because she wasn't feeling the best and wanted some extra help. I told her I had worked at my job already Monday through Thursday and just wanted my days off which are Friday and Saturday. She tried to guilt trip me into going by telling me I would look terrible in front of her mom which is true I admit. I ended up not going and she tried to tell me she felt like sh!t and needed my help. I changed the subject and asked her about something else and she hasn't responded. So, AITA for deciding not to go to work with her despite her needing help?  "

Of Course, I would go every single year. \\n\\nI use to cry about it when I was younger because I wanted a mom, but as I got older I cried less and less just naturally moved on about my life it was hard for my brother because he always wanted a mom he was depressed a lot and I was there for him but we didn’t share the same feelings because in my eyes at least I had 1 parent.\\n\\nFast forward now our birthday is coming up in May and my friends and I booked a trip to Jamaica and the days lined up with the date my mother passed on. I was fine with it because I thought “What’s one year to miss?” My Mothers side unfortunately wasn’t okay with it and blew the whole situation out of proportion in my opinion.\\n\\nMy Aunt and Grandma were basically verbally attacking me saying “I don’t care about her” &amp; “She’s probably turning over in her grave listening to this” and “She would probably be ashamed to have a daughter like me” what got me was “How could you not care about your own mom as much love that she had for you” I blew up.\\n\\nI remember exactly what I said word from word crying and screaming at them. I was saying “You don’t think I care about her I always wanted a mom.. every single time when i was little seeing a mother and her daughter our shopping I cried.

As a result, they put a lot more attention into my father (their only son), and me (their only son's son) compare to all my aunts and their kids. When I was young my dad was a salesman and my mom was a teacher who teaches far away, my grandparents moved out of the countryside where they are the most comfortable in and moved into the big city just to take care of me.\\n\\nRecently my grandfather's health condition has been deteriorating rapidly. He is suffering from Alzheimer's and a lot of other health issues. My parents and I moved to Canada seven years ago and the last time we went back was five years ago. My aunts and my grandma are hoping that we can get back to China to meet with my grandpa while he is still alive. The issue is I am in coop program and my break between each semester is like a week long. The flight to China is also quite expensive. I can't just skip a semester because that means abandoning my half finished capstone project and having to find a new capstone group to join among a class of strangers. But I also feel extremely guilty for not going back to China. My grandparents spend several years taking care of me and raising me up. They always consider me their favorite grandchild but I abandoned them to go live in another country and now I can't even fulfil their simple wish of seeing me in person. I have heard my aunts complaining about how ungrateful I am during video call with my grandparents, about how among all the kids my grandparents could choose to help raise they picked me and I'm the only one not around.

I asked my mom why she was doing that to me, and she told me that because I was breaking my penance by wanting to drink soda, but I told her that I was not avoiding drinking so much soda for a religious penance, but for health, and that It's not so bad to have a soda from time to time, especially considering that we were eating hamburgers, and that we hadn't eaten for several hours.\\n\\n But she said I couldn't play with god like that, and make promises then break them like they meant nothing.\\n\\n  Honestly I don't consider myself a religious person, I believe that we'RE all free to believe in what we want as long as we don't hurt anyone.\\n\\n This morning I had forgotten a little about this, but my dad also TALK TO ME for having failed to comply with my penance. my older sister is also agree with me and told me that my mom is crazy.\\n\\n So  AITA?</td>\n",

Both my brother and I won’t be home (he’s at a sleepover and I’m heading over to go babysitting), which is why I can’t ask him. He doesn’t have a cell, so I can’t call or text either.\\n\\nWe planned a “prank” together (its just a version of the same prank we do every year). This year we are dressing as each other. He would be dressing fancy/paying more attention to his outfit. I would be mismatching with a graphic tee. It’s nice.\\n\\nHowever, I thought that I could do a kind of “double-cross”. I would prank him by dressing like I normally would. It would be him dressing as me and me as me. I thought it might be fun, but at the same time I don’t want him to be mad at me.\\n\\nI would just do it if we were both at home, and then I could change into his clothes. But I can’t. We’ll both be stuck in whatever clothes we brought. Especially since I babysit from 05:30 til 22:00. Without going home.\\n\\nAges are 15f (almost 16!) and 13m. This is all fun, even if he did get mad he’d be over it in an hour. Please don’t start making any assumptions like a lot of AITA people do.  \n",
       "7   I’m 24(F) my mom passed 4 days after giving birth to me and my twin brother. We were raised by our dad who gave us the best life. We grew up with our mothers side of the family as well. Who never let us forget our mother and always was there if we had questions about her. \\n\\nEvery Year on the passing of her death our whole mothers side including my brother and I would go to her grave 3 days before our birthday. Of Course, I would go every single year. \\n\\nI use to cry about it when I was younger because I wanted a mom, but as I got older I cried less and less just naturally moved on about my life it was hard for my brother because he always wanted a mom he was depressed a lot and I was there for him but we didn’t share the same feelings because in my eyes at least I had 1 parent.\\n\\nFast forward now our birthday is coming up in May and my friends and I booked a trip to Jamaica and the days lined up with the date my mother passed on. I was fine with it because I thought “What’s one year to miss?” My Mothers side unfortunately wasn’t okay with it and blew the whole situation out of proportion in my opinion.\\n\\nMy Aunt and Grandma were basically verbally attacking me saying “I don’t care about her” & “She’s probably turning over in her grave listening to this” and “She would probably be ashamed to have a daughter like me” what got me was “How could you not care about your own mom as much love that she had for you” I blew up.\\n\\nI remember exactly what I said word from word crying and screaming at them. I was saying “You don’t think I care about her I always wanted a mom.. every single time when i was little seeing a mother and her daughter our shopping I cried. Not having a mother to teach me about a period, doing my hair, talking about boys. I LITERALLY WANTED ALL OF THAT. But at the same time your feelings about her are different from mom’s you guys both knew my mom y’all watched her grow watched her do everything have endless memories with her I CAN’T GRIEVE NOBODY I NEVER KNEW.” I broke down and just walked out the house and left after that. \\n\\nSince then both my aunt and grandma told me I was disrespectful and it’s still rude for me not to come completely disregarding my feelings and everything I said. The only people that understands me is my twin, dad and grandfather. AITA? \\n\\nP.S.. I’m still going on my trip.  \n",

They heavily value males over females. As a result, they put a lot more attention into my father (their only son), and me (their only son's son) compare to all my aunts and their kids. When I was young my dad was a salesman and my mom was a teacher who teaches far away, my grandparents moved out of the countryside where they are the most comfortable in and moved into the big city just to take care of me.\\n\\nRecently my grandfather's health condition has been deteriorating rapidly. He is suffering from Alzheimer's and a lot of other health issues. My parents and I moved to Canada seven years ago and the last time we went back was five years ago. My aunts and my grandma are hoping that we can get back to China to meet with my grandpa while he is still alive. The issue is I am in coop program and my break between each semester is like a week long. The flight to China is also quite expensive. I can't just skip a semester because that means abandoning my half finished capstone project and having to find a new capstone group to join among a class of strangers. But I also feel extremely guilty for not going back to China. My grandparents spend several years taking care of me and raising me up. They always consider me their favorite grandchild but I abandoned them to go live in another country and now I can't even fulfil their simple wish of seeing me in person. I have heard my aunts complaining about how ungrateful I am during video call with my grandparents, about how among all the kids my grandparents could choose to help raise they picked me and I'm the only one not around. My grandparents still defend me but that just make me feel worse. Should I go back to China? Am I the asshole?  \n",

My parents followed my example, and we just started in the days of easter week.\\n\\n Yesterday we were all very busy, we had barely had some cookies for breakfast at 6 a.m..  so like 3 p.m. we went to eat burgers: I wanted a soda and my mom didn't let me drink it, it bothered me a bit but at least she gave me permission to buy another type of drink.\\n\\n But when the waiter brought it, it was a pretty small glass, think about the games cooking for children:  I asked why she didn't give me all my drink, and my mom said that I shouldn't drink it because of my penance. ,  Obviously that little soda wasn't enough, but my mom refused to give me my drink, and instead she gave me some juice which it wasn't even cold.\\n\\n I protested and my brother gave me my bottle.  I asked my mom why she was doing that to me, and she told me that because I was breaking my penance by wanting to drink soda, but I told her that I was not avoiding drinking so much soda for a religious penance, but for health, and that It's not so bad to have a soda from time to time, especially considering that we were eating hamburgers, and that we hadn't eaten for several hours.\\n\\n But she said I couldn't play with god like that, and make promises then break them like they meant nothing.\\n\\n  Honestly I don't consider myself a religious person, I believe that we'RE all free to believe in what we want as long as we don't hurt anyone.\\n\\n This morning I had forgotten a little about this, but my dad also TALK TO ME for having failed to comply with my penance. my older sister is also agree with me and told me that my mom is crazy.\\n\\n So  AITA?  \n",

You might have some stumbles if you turn the shower room lights off. It is also night time, so no sunlight was coming into the house.\\n\\nAITA for not keeping the lights on in the next connected room and hallway?  \n",

This is a visual novel horror game that at times involves quite intensely graphic gore and body horror. The kind that would have a hard R rating as a movie.\\n\\nAs I was leaving at the end of the flight, the older lady I was seated next to stopped me. She remarked to me that the game I was playing was very disturbing and that it was rude of me to play something like that in a public space where people or kids could see it without meaning to. She said she’d been upset by them and also pointed out that there were young kids in the row behind us. Oops. \\n\\nI apologized for bothering her, although I don’t know why she didn’t ask me to stop during the flight if the images bothered her, I would have! The kids I genuinely hadn’t noticed (they were very well behaved), but anyway their parents didn’t complain and I got no signals that’s they’d been upset or even seen what I was doing. \\n\\nReddit, was I an asshole for playing something upsetting in a public space that others can’t escape from? I might be, because I understand that in a plane when you’re like walking up the aisle from the bathroom or seated next to them it’s hard not to observe people’s screens. I empathize with the notion of being a kid and getting traumatized for life by an upsetting image seen in a public space. On the other hand, I might not be the asshole, because isn’t it other’s responsibility to just look away if they don’t like it? \\n\\nI genuinely can’t decide. I leave the issue in your hands.  \n",
